141900,DsBDwdCCsdHclqRn81hY1A,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"I have been coming here for a long time. However with time passing, so does this restaurant. When floors looked nice, bathrooms were presentable and smelled decent, and looked clean, for the past 3 years.. my folks love the won-ton mein, but the rest of the restaurant is horrible. I can't stand coming to this restaurant. It was only a few days ago when my mom said ""we aren't coming here anymore."" I have to make a review of this restaurant. The floors looked like they were going to remodel it, but never got the chance or they'd rather keep the money to themselves. Maybe get paid higher, and avoid the floor costs. The floor has been looking like it was a road in a chinese village since 2 years ago. I remember they were changing ownerships, which could be the reason to be the downfall of this restaurant. The broth for the noodle soup had no taste at all. the floors are blackened, and i had seen a waiter drop the napkins and chopsticks on the dirty, yet blackened floor. You would think he would put them in the dirty bin, yet he blew on the chopsticks wiped them with a cloth and put them back in the drawer. he also fanned out the napkins and put them back as well. OMG i just wanted to puke. What they should do? In my opinion, if it was my restaurant. Get someone to clean the restroom on an hourly basis to refill the amenities. Also downsize the restaurant, so you can afford to get flooring. If not carpet, some cheap tiles. Maybe keep the size of the restaurant and lease half of it to a boba place so then you can finally afford to fix the flooring, and maybe have a decent bathroom. I had to wait til we left and headed to rio, so i could use the restroom. Avoid this at all costs. You rather go and get some mc donalds or pho!",1,0,5
141901,IPU5myAXlLxe-IRiOE4w7w,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Lunch (11am-5pm) & Late Night Specials (for $4.95, and the portions are generous, definitely the right spot to hit up for decent hot meal on a glacial global economic recovery budget.  That was how I felt about the economy back in 2011. Vegas has definitely recovered a lot from the dismal lows, but not really back to what it was before the crash.  So I continue to seek out decent restaurants that is budget friendly, and Caf√© Noodle & Chinese Barbeque continues to be near the top of my list for curing hunger on a tight budget.

Like many other Yelpers have mentioned, the restaurant is not the cleanest.  Even after clearing a recently vacated table and sanitizing it, it still feels not quite clean. Maybe it is that lingering thin film of grease or they simply needed to use a cleaner rag to clean the tables.  Well, at least the utensils and tea cups are clean.

Anyway, I ended up here at Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque, a restaurant that I have walked past numerous times to other businesses in this super busy plaza with the ridiculously inadequate parking spaces. However, the American name is completely foreign to me, and to locate it I had to look up the driving direction.  The place was relatively crowded at 11pm on a Tuesday night, and pretty much every patron was Asians.  I immediately sensed a good vibe that this place must be at least decent.

After looking over the menu, I opted for the Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings appetizer (tasty but on the greasy side, occasionally not very flavorful due to insufficient amount of ""salt & pepper"") and the Pan Fried Noodles with Beef and Vegetable (very large portion and pretty flavorful).  The food is not high end, but for the prices they are charging you, it is well worth it.  That was from my very first visit back in 2011, and the incomplete review draft sat and sat and sat some more until now.

So two years have gone by and several visits later (both dine-in and take-out), my impression remained roughly the same.  Service for the most part is their weak point.  Not the friendliest or most attentive, but occasionally you will get a waiter that stepped up his game (a refreshing change). Then there are times when you end up standing there for 5 minutes wanting to place an order and be completely ignored by the lady behind the counter and ultimately walk out and head across the street to another near 24/7 Chinese restaurant that is just as good, if not better.

The food at great value is what keeps me coming back once I get over their latest service mishaps. 
What I do recommend here:
* 2 BBQ Items Combo on Rice (I usually get their BBQ Duck and Soya Chicken) - it will set up back $8.75
* Spicy Eggplant Hot Pot - one of my favorites
* Salted Fish & Chicken Fried Rice - I usually get this to go plus something else. Slightly adventurous due to the salted fish.
* Any of their Pan Fried Flat Rice Noodle dishes - but sometimes it is a little greasy, so drink plenty of hot tea!
* Crispy Fried Chicken (all day special dine-in only offer for $5.95 each) - that is a very sweet and filling deal!

From 3PM to 5PM, they have a limited ""High Tea"" menu, customers get a free HK style milk tea or coffee (hot or cold) along with your order. Not an awesome promo, but if you have to pay for said complimentary beverage it will cost you $2.50.  

NOTE: In their recent Chinese newspaper ads, they have all day specials from $4.95 to $7.95, but I have never tested that during normal dinner time.

Minimum for credit card use is $15, so order enough or bring cash.

Review #1 of 2014. Checked!",4,1,5
141902,7cNV7l_VpNBghK5NlWWV7Q,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Our family discovered this restaurant last years. We liked the. Simple Chinese food and the prices were inexpensive. We just visited this cafe twice in a week. The first trip we found a used tea bag in the tea pot  the server gave us. I brought it to the Manager attention and he apologized sincerely. he explained that sometimes customers bring their own tea bag into the restaurant. Since we enjoyed the food, we decided to let the matter rest. Two days later, we visited this restaurant again. The food was reasonably tasty. However, when we asked for the bill, that is when our entire experience went down the drain! We normally do not check the items listed on the receipt and like many we merely pay the total amount as shown. This time for no reason we checked the items listed on the bill and found out shockingly that an item of $3/- was automatically added into the bill without even informing the customer! Normally we leave cash on the table but in this instance we were shocked! how can a waitress or establishment secretly and automatically add on ""tips"" onto the bill and not inform the customer? Also if we did not even notice the ""tips"" we would have double tip bec we always leave 20% behind anyway! When we confronted the waitress and asked how can she do such a secretive billing, she merely tried to cover it up by giving ridiculous reasons ..she explained that when the convention is in town, they always add automatic tip onto every customer bill. Such practice left us totally disgusted and we pledged we will not visit this establishment ever. We learn now to check every item on the bill because you never know what extra item can be added. 

Alash a cheating waitress drove away future customer business...what a shame!",1,0,3
141903,Hh0yaiXQZ46X5wsF_AAx2Q,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"horrible experience ! This restaurant makes us feel like they are dishonest. One waitress appears very very sneaky.  This was our third visit and our waitress was very rude. she talked to us with disrespect and treated us like crap,! we just sat down and wanted to have a peaceful dinner. then when she handed us our bill which  we found out that the waitress added a few dollars tip without informing the us.  She wrote the amount on our bill! this place is very dishonest. Hiw can they write their own tip onto customer bills without telling the,? we are never going back there again. if you want to risk going there, make sure you check the bill for every item....do not be fooled!",1,1,10

food was good, not great. 

Price: 
more expensive than other restaurants I've been to.

Overall, would not come back.",3,0,4

2) Price is good for Vegas.
3) Not much of a wait for lunch and dinner
4) Service is good from the waitresses that's if you don't get the owner helping you, she is very mean. 
5) Tables are sticky so make sure you wipe down before setting your arms on top of it.",4,0,8
141906,wrvDVk6HCDBfYE1SfN92cQ,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Great prices and great specials $4.95 beef with prayer sauce was very good and good sized portion. $4.95 mandarin pork was good as well again good sized portion. Both dishes could of easily been a filling meal but for that price me and the gf figured the portion has to be small we better order another dish.

 She got the shrimp and pork wonton soup which was ok not the greatest. They didn't skip on the wontons like some places do it probably had 5 or 6 good sized ones. It also had rice noodles and bok choy mixed in. I order the $5.95 bbq pork and noodles which was ehh not to favorable. You can tell them to make the noodles spicier if desired. We only finished one dish between the two of us and took the rest home.

The service was pretty good not the greatest but better then most places. Not the type of place to take Someone you're trying to impress but great for a quick bite. Complimentary tea was a plus and the food arrived very fast. Me and the gf were very impressed as we weren't expecting much from this place we were just looking for a late night meal after work. We will prob be regulars here in the future.",4,0,4
141907,y7lIeD4YvV3VYQ7oxj0JGA,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"Worst food and service, I asked them to bring me an ice water 3 times, I have to go get the menu by myself, the answer was They are busy, it was only 3 tables with 2 servers,how busy would be?  and every time I went always see the woman counted her money for 30 mins, ""Don't go to this place"", the staff speaks loud with bad words in front of the guest..",1,0,10

Food is tasty and portions are large. Quick service and friendly staff. We come here mostly after midnight because the place can be packed during the day. The place could use some major renovations, though. But overall, I like it!",4,1,6
141909,Ar8Buoe34ueCXhyYFq-8Yg,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,Service is bad and also the food here are awful. Prob is one of the worst Chinese food. Not gonna come back here again.,1,0,2
141910,CkU4Zlu66c59fc8R25KJXg,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,Food is good and reasonably priced BUT BEWARE restrooms !!!! Deep clean and sanitize thoroughly as well as the dining area  floors. They are dark colored but steam and strip the floor. Makes you wonder if the kitchen is up to par?!?! They posted A grade rating...really !?! I think they would improve star rating if they made the place more inviting and clean,2,0,5

I usually go here after basketball at tark. I enjoy their whole chicken, pan fried noodles, whole sole fish and fried shrimp. They have a discounted menu after 11pm as well. If it wasn't for the tasty food I wouldn't give them my business.",3,0,8
141912,2TDGcewWgsJuvnQYMNmHhg,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,Food is good for the price. The place is pretty big with lots of big family table. The lunch menu starts off at 5 dollars ! Very good service for Chinatown!!!! I ordered preserved vegetables with intestines and ma po tofu. Both very authentic! I always take my family here!,4,1,9
141913,z6H2Eap7-sH5uHm6S2oXuw,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"i went here quite often. Most of their food is good. The pork chop is awesome, wonton n suei kiaw soup is wonderful. Beef flat rice noodle is delicious, salt pepper squid is good too. I usually happy w/ their food. Service is so so, depends who ur server is.
Beware!! Their chix wing!! They serve it to me is medium, still bloody!! Gross!!",3,0,4
141914,W5WNoVblMiLd664Uewzebg,AFDFOs2GaIyUArGyEUDQzQ,"I must say, this is definitely not on my ""favorite, oh my gosh I love this place"" Chinese joints. I love the price of the stuff here, and I always end up finding myself here to feed a big group of people, or to fix a really really late night craving for Chinese food. 

Service is generally really fast, but the food is normally on the salty side, like ""oh my gosh I can totally taste the MSG"" and I normally get a headache after eating here and I think it's from the seasoning, or just the MSG they add to the meals. The place isn't super clean, but it's not disgusting dirty. I do like the taste of their hot tea here that they serve. 
 
Food is nicely portioned, so like I said, I definitely like the price of everything here especially because they have the ""special price/portioned"" menu. It's easy to feed a party of 10+ more people and end up only paying $10-$15 each if you split the bill'' and you'll have order a shit load of food, like over 6 or 7 dishes. This is a good place to come and eat if you're hungry and you wanna split the bill so you can try everything that's ordered.

They normally do a good job at accommodating very large groups. Bathroom isn't all that clean, so I would suggest hold it if you can. 

Oh and parking is a total bitch in the plaza where this restaurant is located so know you have been warned. When the parking lot is full (which it normally is always full) you have to park in the Chinatown parking lot next to this plaza.",2,1,9

I'm used to bad customer service, especially at chinese restaurants, but these girls take it to a whole another level.  The dining room has the sense of a public bathroom, and their restrooms are absolutely wretched, vomit inducing .  Seriously, put some money into the bathrooms at least.",1,0,5
142882,IiWE20cRlJ1YEEcebsxV-g,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"My mother REALLY wanted to try this place out when we came to Vegas, despite my arguing against it. There were tons of people waiting for a table, both in the restaurant and outside, so she kept saying ""Well it has to be good since there's so many people here !!"" How I wished that was true.
The wait wasn't too bad. 10~15 minutes.
I got the calamari, and it sucked. Hated it.
We ordered some beef entree and they didn't give it to us until near the end of the meal. Even after several reminders. Idk how the rest of the food was because I was too busy trying to eat the horrible calamari.
My water was only refilled once. 20 minutes after it's been sitting at the edge of the table completely empty. I guess it's not that big of a deal but it is to me. I mean, I would have asked for a refill myself if I could flag someone down but noo they were all running around serving other tables, and being apparently much too busy to attend to our one table.",2,1,4
142883,0_xIFMnhD0RZAySzQFQZeA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"I base my reviews on the food, service, and atmosphere. Given that, this place was pretty average for a pho place. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and large in size. It 's fairly busy every time I've drove passed it. I ordered my usual beef broth with rare flank steak. The broth was in my opinion, very tasty. I didn't need to add too much extra sauces like usual. The prices are a little bit more than I'm use to for the portion, but not too bad. So if you're looking for a good pho spot in Chinatown, Pho Kim Long is a safe bet.",3,1,10
142884,OOgIRkNzD_bFif-D0zvBoA,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Pho Kim long. Fun e nam! Don't you think? Well if your a local or party with locals chances are you will probably end up here after a night out for some drunk munchies or after a wicked hangover sets in and your in dire need of liquids containing pho noodles.  The food good. The atmosphere is questionable. If you come here sober you'll probably run into someone you know who is plastered. Fun? Maybe. Enjoyable? That depends if you get anything good to use on them! Jk, sorta. 
Seriously though the food is good. Order something other than the pho you'll be surprised it's pretty damn good! I like the crab Rangoon and the peppered beef. 
Ooo and the Thai boba is yummy! Don't get the fruit flavored ones they use the artificial fruit stuff. 
The seating sucks and the bathroom is not so clean. If you like lots of ppl, a noisy restaurant, and pretty decent food than give pho Kim long a try. What could it hurt. I've def done worse drunk.",3,0,8

Mine (with various meats) and his (chicken) came out very quickly and had nice flavor. We were seated at a giant round table even though it was just the two of us and our 1 year old.

This place seems to be popular with the locals as it was buzzing with people--for a random Thursday during the hours of lunch. The wait isn't that long though so don't fret. Our sever was semi okay, but my friends seemed to think otherwise as he made faces when my friend asked for a substitution. The food was average. I don't think any of us thought it was poorly made or anything great in nature. 

I had some sort of Japanese fried noodle. I really can't remember exactly what it was. It tasted okay, but I thought it was a bit on the oily side. I think other menu item choices would have been better. My friend's fiancee had the pho ga, he said it was good. 

I really like the fact that this restaurant is in the China Town area so you can definitely take your pick of other restaurants. There's plenty of dessert and drink choices to chose from as well.",3,1,6

After seeing lines going out the door 3 nights in a row at this restaurant, I decided I had to give this place a try.

The spring rolls were fabulous.
The pho was delicious.
The service was meh. 

The 3 color dessert was horrendous. You get a plastic cup, a mound of shaved ice on top that is impossible to eat with a plastic spoon because the ice hardens, and the green gelatin layer tastes like green hardened rice noodles. The coconut milk, instead of being liquid, freezes with the ice. Quite disappointing, really, to eat such a poorly prepared yet simple dessert.

Unfortunately (in more ways than one), we patronized this restaurant sober as a blade of grass. On a Sunday morning, I found this place to be quite dark. Again, the dark would have been appreciated had I been hung over or still buzzing. The pho broth was salty and unbalanced. It tasted like it had too much star anise. 

I was adventurous and ordered the bun bo hue. Huge mistake-- again salty broth, the veggies that normally accompanies this disk appeared sad. The offering of frest mint was very stingy. Instead of cabbage, there were pieces of ripped up lettuce. Sure, they may not have red cabbage, but they could have at least cut up the lettuce nicely.",1,0,3

This place doesn't seem to have any rule for waiting list. I am not talking about special, excellent customer care for us  from them, considering their location.

   Especially  unprofessional manager doesn't seem to know what he's doing for customer care.
  
  Ha Ha!!!  How stupid they are and  treated customer as just trouble makers!!!.  Also, I have never seen any security guard  in this kind of  local  restaurant. I figured out  easily why they hired a big guy like a night club and how many times they kicked even their customers easily.

We asked if we could barrow their calculator and he says we have to use our own and figure it ourselves and then he answers the phone and completely ignores us.

This place I normally don't refer to friends but I decided to give this place one more shot due to my close friends wanting to eat this last night. Last night was the final draw for this place never have I ever felt violated, disrespected, and degraded in my life. We go here about 2:30 am after a night of long work and studying. It took the waiter 40 mins to take our order. We didn't get our compliment water, napkins, and utensils till all orders arrived. Numerous times have we tried to call a waiter over and cater to us all we got was stares and shut downs. They ignored for about 5 times, as they walked over and looked at us. As we finished up and was ready to pay, we waited at the cashier table for about 20 mins. The so called manager/owner comes through a young skinny Asian boy. He tell him that we are going to split the check into two my friend will pay first and I'll pay second. We have a group of four people and two people on one check the other two on the next check. He tells us we have to figure it our ourselves. We ask for a calculator right in front of him he tells us no you figure it our yourselves. The phones rings as we were try to talk to him he ignores is the whole time. At this point I  furious poor service, and now dealing with an ass of an owner. He tells me to ""shut the fuck up"" ""stop giving him attitude"" he also calls me a ""bitch"". At this point I'm ready to knock his ass out but I have to keep it collective, no one ever talks to me this way I was raised to knock bitches out if I was dissected especially in the way he treated me last night. I tell him ""bitch"" you do not know me don't you ever talk to me in that tone ever again. He then tells me to ""fuck off"" I don't care. I pay give no tip. As we were leaving he then runs outside trying to find security to kick me and my friends out saying we were trespassing when clearly I have to stay to pay the bill unless you want me to have a free meal. I leave he then tells me to ""get the fuck out"".

The ingredients were WAY over-cooked to the point that I thought the squid were random pieces of wonton that had fallen into the pot, completely devoid of flavour and with a splatty texture. Shrimp were pink and white curly cues pared from superball material and the cheapy sort, very small sans tail.

Couldn't put my finger on it, but the broth did not have the flavor explosion I am accustomed to in pho. I wasn't bad per se, but I've had waaaay better pho. Bland. 

The service on the other hand was terrible. I almost walked out of the restaurant because the server helped two other tables that came in after me and still had me sit there for 5 minutes after. He failed to bring out my spring rolls and then hassled me when I asked to have my nonexistent spring rolls removed from the bill. 

Kudos for them being open 24/7, but there are at least 5 better pho joints with .5 miles. Go there.",2,0,6

You know this place is good when you see the line of Asians standing outside and overflowing into the parking lot. This place starts to get pretty busy around noon, so try to beat the crowd if you can because they don't take reservations. It's a dollar or two more expensive then the pho you're used to paying for at home, but it's good. I love all of their rice plates and side dishes too. When I go with groups we always get the greenbeans with minced pork and garlic. Soooo yummy! They're not too far from the strip either, so if you need to cab it, it won't be too expensive.",4,1,7

Been here twice and of the 1001 pho places in Vegas, this one inches higher than the rest, but still isn't perfect.

Food: I typically order pho with brisket, flank and tendon. Tendon is hit or miss in most Vietnamese places. Both times i've been here i've had issue with it, the first time i got one small piece and this last time i got several inedible hard chunks. The broth is quite good though. I also get a Vietnamese iced coffee. I am used to it coming in the drip brewer at the table and pouring it myself, its kinda fun, but here they brew it in the servers station and deliver it in a styrofoam cup. not a deal breaker, but i like doing it myself.

Service: Good. There is usually a wait to get in because of the popularity but there is ample serving staff and i never feel like i'm invisible or ignored. English is a second language for most of the staff so communication barriers exist but can be overcome with patience.

Atmosphere: nice place, nothing major to note.",4,0,6

This place is busy! Noticed that patrons tend to be either party-goers or families. Food is ok, not fantastic. I got the rice noodle with barbecued pork and egg rolls while my bf got his usual chicken pho. Didn't think too highly of the food, but when you are starving, it actually left me pretty satisfied. I can see myself coming here before going out for a party or after a clubbing night.

We flew into Vegas and got situated in our home base (Treasure Island) at around 11pm. We got to Pho Kim Long, and giggled like idiotic teenage boys, at around midnight. The place was slammed. Super busy. We were seated immediately, and the hostess was incredibly friendly. We call this ""Las Vegas"" friendly. Like they're so used to tourists, it's just second nature to make the assumption that we're not from the area and treat us kindly so as not to destroy our vacation. There's a lot of this over there, and for that we're super grateful, being earthy, awkward Portlandians. 

We ordered our drinks (I just had water, my partner ordered a beer) and before my partner's beer even had the chance to arrive we were served our starter (the salad rolls), followed quickly by the two delicious orders of Pho. Their peanut sauce was splendid, and the pho makes this my second favorite of all pho places I've been to, ESPECIALLY at midnight! The beer, unfortunately, came toward the end of dinner which is a no-no as far as my partner is concerned. Given the volume of customers that night, and the wonderful food and friendly, quick service, it was forgivable enough for us to come back and order take away to take back to our room a couple nights later when we were actually craving that delicious soup! We cannot wait to order from them again, in house or take away, either way the food is just as wonderful!",4,0,9

We are pretty lucky here in Vancouver to have access to an abundance of Vietnamese restaurants but I was excited to find something in Vegas with the same quality and taste as the restaurants back home.

It is open 24 hours so one of my visits was after the club - it was busy but we didn't have to wait.
On another night that we went to eat here there was a 20 minute wait but that was around dinner time so that should be expected.

I had the grilled chicken on rice (loved it!) the chicken was tender and moist and it even had the criss-cross grill marks on it.
On another night I had the beef pho and it was delicious. As with all food in the US it felt a little heavy on the sodium but it wasn't bad like the places that put tons of MSG in their soups for flavour meanwhile inducing days of thirst after consumption.
On the night that we went after the club I had the chicken fried rice and it was really good. Huge portions so we even took the rest to go.

They didn't understand a word I said and gave me the wrong type of pho. And the thing that pissed me off the most is that the cashier expects you to know how much your meal was. If you go up and tell them you don't know, they stand there and tell you to calculate it. And in the customer point of view, THAT IS THE EMPLOYEE'S JOB. Then they just throw out a random number if you don't know what it is. 

Second, the soup to noodle ratio is inefficient. They provide more soup and less noodles. I'd rather pay for more noodles, I mean that's what pho is right, A NOODLE SOUP. I want to get my money's worth. Also, they aren't careful with how they handle their bowls. Since their is too much soup, it spills over the edge. And they don't even clean it up for you. I also tried my cousin's boba, and it was garbage.

Overall. This was enough to influence my decision that I'm never going here again. The employees need to learn how to do their jobs and learn to have better customer service skills. I do not recommend Pho Kim Long for pho lovers.",1,0,10

They have won some ""best of"" awards and that has really helped their business.  But with popularity comes the price increases!! Hey, it's a business and they want to make money so I get it.  

They updated their menu with pricing and graphics, but the dining room is still the same.

Upon entering, it's in a regular old strip mall. There's enough parking fronting the restaurant. I didn't have many high expectations of this place. The seating reminded me of a traditional Chinese restaurant with round tables, rather than a Vietnamese restaurant.

Service was ok, but not overly friendly. I got the shrimp banh xeo for the appetizer, which is a shrimp fried pancake with mint, lettuce and other conidments to wrap it in. Delicious, crispy but not too oily.

I ordered the pho tai nam. I love their broth. Very rich, piping hot and tasty. Noodles were cooked well and not too hard or soggy. Plenty of condiments from the sweet basil, beans sprouts, garlic chili oil sauce, etc.  I would say the best broths I've tasted ever. Beats any broth in Hawaii hands down.

On a Sunday afternoon after a night of partying on the strip, their pho did it's job. One of my biggest pet peeves is when lemon wedged are served on the side with pho. Who does that?! No doubt, it should always always always be lime wedges!! Service was good. The other menu items looked good at the table next to us. However, we only had their pho.

I always recommend this place to out of town friends who are looking for after hours grub, especially after drinking... and they never fail to impress. I think that they are a little bit pricey for a vietnamese restaurant, and the customer service could be a bit better on some days, especially when packed... but overall, i still like going here.

143023,zG8NBg5UMQRCedfpgt1hkg,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Unbelievable. This place is a joke! The employees and manager are beyond ridiculous. 

Here is the story. My mother and I had gone right now and had ordered some food and one of the many foods we ordered was Chicken Pad Thai. When our dish came out and we ate couple chopstick full & looked at this so called ""chicken"" that was thinly sliced, chewy and what seemed and look like fat attached was simply ""pork"". 

Like any customers would, we called over our waiter, he took it back unsure as well than ANOTHER waiter aggressively came back with the dish and claimed it was chicken. We argued about this for several mins & because we didn't want to make a bigger scene we told him to take the dish back. 

NOW, this next part gets better. As we continue to eat our rest of the food, the waiter and his other employees gather around near by we were sitting and have the nerves to talk about our situation and laugh about it. So, as a customer I was furious. Asked for the manager to let him be aware of his employees behavior. Of course -_- manager isn't any better with his behavior so possibly that's why his employees aren't any better either -_- so anyways, manager comes to our table, not making any eye contact with me and fights for his employees (which is understandable defending his employees). Finally got an apology and ended the conversation. 

This gets even better, once the check arrives, we were charged for Chicken Pad Thai (in most case in other restaurants, the dish is taken off the check) so we only paid for what we only ate and with that kind of a crappy service, we didn't leave tip. As we were leaving, the manager came out to our car and told us we didn't pay enough. This is how the conversation went:

Manager: ""you didn't pay enough!""
Me: ""no, we paid for what we ate.""
Manager: ""shut up!""

So at this point, I was beyond furious and got out of our car and went up to him and he had the nerve to say he didn't tell me to shut up. So now I'm apparently gone crazy and hearing things -_- then he aggressively argues with me that I didn't pay enough, so I had to RE-EXPLAIN to him that we ONLY paid for what we actually ate and not what was taken back (since we didn't eat it!). 

This is where he failed miserably as a manager...not only did he verbally fight back, tell me to shut up, but he had his biggest nerves to tell me my service was unwanted there and for me to ""go to hell"". 

Uhm, are you serious right now?! How in the world can a restaurant manager say all that to a customer?????!!!!!! My mind was so blown away. Un-freaking-believe-able! For sure NEVER going back there and it is such a disappointment cause I been going there for many years now. I seriously think they are so full of it!

This place is terrible! My whole family got sick after eating here. As I lay here feeling full of regret and in disbelief of how disgusting our dinner was here, my stomach is extra tender and sore and my mouth is numb and dehydrated. 

I'm full Vietnamese and this place is such a huge embarrassment and a disgrace to real authentic Vietnamese food. 

First offense - the goi cuon (shrimp and pork spring rolls/ summer rolls) were tiny and barely had any filling inside. A piece of lettuce, a tiny bit of noodles, a sliver of meat and 3 slivers of shrimp. Oh, and that so called dipping sauce was so gross! Super watered down. What a ripoff. 

Second offense - Msg was never really an issue for me and it never really caused me any problems, until I ate here. Also, my uncle is really sensitive to it and he had a lot of issues with his pho. He didn't drink any of his pho broth because it had too much MSG and by the end of dinner he started to feel sick. 

Third offense - the nuoc cham (fish sauce/dipping sauce) was so watered down, that I ended up asking them for 3 bowls for my meal - but even 3 bowls was not enough and I finally gave up. It was disgustingly bland. I was pretty much pouring sugar water onto my rice. 

Fourth offense - my pork chop was dry and the marinade was bland. The charring on the pork chop tasted artificial. 

Fifth offense - our tongue is all sorts of numb and shriveled up after eating here. I guess MSG does that to you. We're extremely weak, thirsty and dehydrated now. 

Sixth offense - the chow fun beef noodles in gravy (hu tieu xao bo) was so unappetizing and unappealing, I was in disbelief they served it to us. They overcooked the chow fun noodles so they broke up into a billion of small pieces when you tried to pick them up with chopsticks, the gravy was all watery and goopy. It was not tasty at all.

Right when we were seated, we were asked what we wanted to order FOUR TIMES within a 10 minute time period. Barely having any time to think, the manager asks after his second time, ""Ready to order? There are people waiting to eat so you guys should hurry and make a selection"". (He said something rude along the lines of that). They are basically just trying to get people in, take the money, and kick them out. This is definitely the worst customer service I've ever had in a restaurant.

My boyfriend and I went and we ordered two #13 combination phos and I also ordered a tai tea boba. About 3 minutes later our pho is served to us but not my drink.

Well, I thought, ""Oh, maybe they're still making it"" so about another good 5 minutes passes by & my boba is still not served to me & I started to question my thoughts about this place. So we asked one of the waiters where my boba was and he just walked off without any acknowledgement or reassurance that it was coming. So we waited another 10 minutes and my boyfriend and I are just about done with our pho and still....no....tai tea boba. I asked another waiter, ""Hi excuse me, I've been waiting for about 10 minutes for my tai tea boba now and I still haven't gotten it."" & he got the job done but he didn't even apologize for the long wait.

What ruins this is the service. There was absolutely no attention paid to us. Over half the time I was there I had no water. I tried getting the attention of three different workers and was ignored. When two busboys were bussing the table besides us I asked one of them if we could have more water. He barely looked at me and said hold on with his index finger up. That whole time afterwards I was watching him and there were times he had nothing to do and still didn't refill our drinks. Even after making eye contact with him multiple times he still didn't come.

On a good note we were seated immediately upon arrival during the Lunch Rush Hour. Our waitress was fast, and friendly, She even fixed our bill for us as there was an error and we were charged for something we did not order.

Today I went for lunch with my friends and reluctantly got #13.. It was really good today. The serving was generous and it came out quickly. I know that can be a bad thing but it was a good thing today since we were hungry. The amount of meat for the price was good also. The broth was good and they have us a generous amount of herbs and sprouts.

We got two appetizers the crab rangoons and the egg rolls. They were both good but nothing special.

I took the time out to write this quick review because the service was so good today.

Usually the staff is pretty short and rude.

It seems with the increased business they're getting they took the time to improve the service.

We arrived a little after 2am on a Wednesday night, there was a line and I didn't mind. I'd have to say that's the only negative thing I encountered.

So for starters I ordered the Fried Potstickers and the Crispy Calamari. The potstickers were just perfect and full of flavor. The calamari I absolutely fell in love with! Fried to a perfect golden brown crisp, on a bed of cabbage and peppers with a cocktail sauce on the side. All the flavors were right and it made me want another order soon as I was done!

For entree I had the Roasted Duck with Peanuts and a sweet and sour sauce. The duck was seasoned and roasted to a tee and the sauce along with the peanuts and cilantro really connected all of the flavors as one. One of the best plates of duck I've had in a while!

The wait for 5 the Monday afternoon following EDC weekend was about 20-25 minutes. Not bad considering what a packed weekend it was and the families buzzing around.

Got the Pho Tai Nam with tai on the side. They confused my order. I ordered a small, I got a large. I ordered tai on the side, they gave me tai with an extra order of tai on the side. It's okay, though! It was really THE hangover cure. The broth wasn't too shabby, a bit too much sodium for my taste, but I don't inhale the broth so it was okay.

The smoothies are packed with powders, but still delicious. I'd get the avocado one over the mango one, though. The avocado powder is at least masked by the creaminess of the milk and had a better aftertaste. 

The decor is extremely modern! I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure why I was expecting something more rundown with 70s decor, haha. Maybe I'm just used to frequenting those types of joints. Just don't come in here with high hopes of having a deep conversations -- all the sounds are literally bouncing off the walls.

The soup is as close to homemade as you can get at a restaurant (especially in Las Vegas, NV). Small selection of meats, but the meats that they do offer are good. They pile on the meats but don't give you enough noodles. They are generous with the vegetables - I asked for extra basil and limes, and they gladly gave me a small plateful.

The food is good and isn't too pricey.  Some of their portions look a lil small when your stomach is growling at you because you've realized just then that man/woman cannot survive on just alcohol and chlorine alone. LOL.  But, it's just enough to satisfy your hunger. I love that this is a 24 hour spot. Too late and you will see some drunks in here acting stupid but nothing over the top to get 'em kicked out. The wait staff are all pretty irritable seeming. LOL. I am not shocked. Their Pho isn't bad but it was a lil too salty for me. My godson, 3 years old, loves their egg rolls and their chow mein. He also likes their grilled pork and chicken. Visits here tend to be with our family who are also out in Vegas, either living there or other family who are just visiting, like us. There can be a wait. So, be prepared for that. And make sure that you give the host your name and that he WRITES IT DOWN on his clip board. Otherwise, you'll be passed up a few times.  I think that was the part that my husband disliked the most.  We'd been standing in the wait area for a while and nobody came to seat us. All of a sudden, 4 punk kids walk in and all of a sudden they are being seated. NOPE. My husband walked past those 4 kids and sat down, knowing that we should be helped first. The kids didn't say anything. They knew that we'd been there before them. The host was confused and my husband had to explain to him what had happened. The host said that he thought that we got there after those kids who he saw just walk in moments before he motioned to them to come and sit.  Anyway, my husband talked to the manager and all was well.  That was just the one time. It hasn't happened ever again since then. 

Food is good. The prices are about right. The pho broth tends to be a lil salty at night. The egg rolls are my godson's fave. They accept cash and card. There is parking all over and it's a 24 hour spot. I don't think you could ask for much more.",3,0,3

Every time my bf and I travel to the west coast, I always want to try the pho in town.  Pho Kim Long definitely hit the spot.  I was hesitant at first to pick this spot.  Many of the previous reviews had mentioned about the waiters being rude.  We are from New York, we know what rude is!! We didn't have any problem here.  

Deco:  it was very simple, many big family tables.  My bf and I were seated at a table that fits 6 people.  We had the entire table to ourselves, even though there were people waiting for a seat.  In NY Viet restaurants, they would easy make you share a table with total strangers!  Overall, the restaurants and waiters seems somewhat clean.

Food:  I had the pho with sliced raw beef.  The broth was very tasty.  I very much enjoyed it.  I have to say that it was comparable to the pho in NY.  It tasted just as good but cleaner.  It sounds strange but if had the pho from pho bang in ny, you would know what I mean.  

Service: the waiter was attentive and quick.  I'm there for the food, not to make friends.  I just got out of airport security, 5 hrs flight, 1 hr car rental line, I just want quick good food!  This Viet pho spot definitely satisfied my taste buds and made the trip well worth it.",4,1,4

Pho:
The pho here is definitely on point. The broth comes out steaming hot and the broth is seasoned so well. This is one of the places where the broth is so good you'd clean the entire bowl out. It's addicting how good the pho is here. My equally just as good favorite dish to order here is the calamari. It's literally the best calamari I've ever had. They deep fry in a way that isn't super crispy but also is kind of soft in a way. I don't know how they do it but its the perfect deep fried texture. Also, the portion that they give is enormous! It was just two of us and we couldn't kill the entire plate of calamari.

Service:
Service here is okay. They seat you quickly if it's not busy and the food comes out quick. If you get pho, it always comes out before anything else does. The waiters were quick with the refills but if you're there for a while the service get slower and slower. It took us a while for them to realize I was trying to flag them down. Then it took even longer for them to get the check out to us. Service here is my only complaint.

143091,eDlCRpSUF4ITcacpbfJrmw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"My friends and I came to Pho Kim Long to eat dinner around 8PM. Upon first impressions, I liked the decor of the restaurant. It was nicely decorated and roomy. We were also seated immediately. We all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. A couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. My friend and I both ordered Pho Dat Biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the Ga Chien Gion (deep fried chicken with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered Com Chien Tom (shrimp fried rice, $11.50). 

Here came the most disappointing part. I'm not exaggerating when I say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend's deep fried chicken dish. I thought that this dish was pretty good. It wasn't too salty and I loved the fried garlic. Do note that this dish didn't come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. At this point, I'm starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the fried chicken came out, both of the Pho Dat Biet came out. Honestly, I didn't think that it was too good. The broth wasn't anything spectacular and for the ""special"" bowl of Pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special. 

At this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of fried rice STILL has not received has order. We started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven't received the last dish of fried rice. There was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order BEFORE we even got ours! And how is it that the fried rice would be the last dish to come out? Makes no sense to me.... So about 10 minutes after both of the Pho dishes came out, my friend's fried rice finally came out. It didn't look too appealing either... He also mentioned that some of the parts in his fried rice were cold and not warm at all...

I don't know what happened with our order honestly. Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after EDC, clubbing, etc ;]. Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, I'm sure many people there appreciate how late Pho Kim Long is opened. It's possible that at night, they don't have as many cooks in the kitchen or they simply forgot our order... who knows! I most likely wouldn't visit Pho Kim Long to eat again unless I desperately needed some soup or Pho late at night!",2,1,4

It was a fairly busy early Saturday morning.  We were sat pretty quickly which was nice, happy that they have such a quick turnover for tables.

The food is consistently good every time I come here.  Today the dish I usually order (pork chop w/ baked egg) was extra delicious!  They had a special salt & pepper eggplant that was pretty good as well.

The only reason I took away a star was because they forgot my drink order and when I asked for utensils they also forgot to bring some by.  They didn't check on us after all the food was dropped off and we had to go to the counter to get our check.

But all in all, still a great late night place to get your Asian food fix after a night out of clubbing or work!",4,1,7

I came back to this place a year later with my whole family because i enjoyed it the last time we went and the prices were reasonable. My family ordered food that is SUPPOSE to come with rice. The server never told us that a cup of rice would be charged on each person. Who would think rice, so simple and given, would cost so much. When we found out that they charge $15 extra on our bill when it was ALREADY expensive, we questioned the manager about it and they argued with us and told one of the employees to take all the rice, THAT WE WERE EATING, away from us. What happened to customer service and how the customer is always right? What are they going to to do with the used rice? Hopefully throwing it away.

When the bill came out, we realized they ripped us off. We ordered tons of food, they brought out white rice and charged us $15. First of all, a bag of rice is $25 that will last you for a year. They freaking charge you $1.50 per small bowl...WTF??? We didn't even ask for rice and they brought it out for no reason and refused to refund us the money until we argued with them.

I would never come back and I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are tons of restaurants around, there is no reason to come here.

Ca Kho To $18.90
Canh Chua $18.90
Coconut (not fresh) $5.50
Fried Tofu (4 )  $10
Rice - $15 for a bucket 

Vietnames food should not be this expensive. This place is NOT an upscale restaurant. I rather spend this amount at a Thai, Japanese,  or other upscale restaurants. Coconut is usually $2.50, Ca Kho To is usually under $10. If the food was superb, I don't mind paying for it but it wasnt.",1,0,4

After indulging yourself for days in The Entertainment Capital of the World, give your kidney  and wallet a rest and come here for some cheap good eats.  I like their egg roll bun with a side of spring rolls.  Nothing like a light vermicelli dish with all my favorite vegetables and some fried fatty egg rolls to soak up all the boozing and food from Sin City.  The prices are reasonable and service is fast.  I don't normally want something hot for the car ride home since it makes me sleepy so bun is the way to go for me.  Maybe one day I'll try their pho.

Anyways, Pho Kim Long is 24/7 so it's a perfect for all the clubrats and the hungover boozers.  Chances are, if it's after midnight and you're there, you're probably a clubrat or a barfly yourself.  We're all just one big family here.",4,0,10

It was 7 am and this seemed to be the only place open in Chinatown so it was my perfect opportunity to finally try it.

I was craving pho the last couple weeks which naturally guided me to select from the pho section of their extensive menu. I went with a #13 which was a beef combination pho and included meatballs, tendon, rare beef and brisket. The broth and noodles were right on point with its flavor and wasn't too bland or strong like at some other spots. The meats were good, except for the meatballs which had a weird taste to it. 

This is a fairly large restaurant and probably the biggest pho place I've seen. Do people have parties here like they do at Chinese restaurants? Let's have a pho-king party!

I've been their customer for about six and a half years now and probably visited this restaurant more than 80 times. Highly recommend their springs rolls (which is a bit over-priced but it's tasty so it's worth the extra few dollars $$), their fried egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and combination pho! They have other selections that aren't just Vietnamese cuisine but that of Chinese, Thai, Korean, and Japanese (very little but still present).

Their prices have increased over the years but their taste still gives them the huge reputation they have. Sometimes my visits vary a bit with them when it comes to their service; either they're really awesome and friendly OR they're lifeless and non-attentive.

But if I don't share this experience, I'm not being true to my Yelp self or my fellow Yelpers out there. Every restaurant has a bad night and I have been going to Pho Kim Long since before moving to Las Vegas. The service is efficient and the food always delivers, whether you are there at 7pm or 4 in the morning. But recently I had an experience that has put me off of my beloved go-to spot possibly forever. 

It all started on a busy Friday night around 3am. I had a craving for some Pho after work. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table because they were jam packed, slammed, crazy busy. No problem. I get it. Not the end of the world. 
However, once we were finally sat all the way in the back in a corner, nobody came to take our order. There were servers, bussers and runners all scurrying around us too busy to even take a beverage order. The first 10 or so minutes I can forgive but when I actively am trying to flag someone down and literally every employee refuses to make eye contact, even I start to get frustrated. We became the table that time forgot. 

15 minutes...20 minutes go by.
25 minutes in and we still don't even have a glass of water. We have now been at Pho Kim Long for a total of 40 minutes with nothing to show for it. But I refuse to be that person who makes a scene and leaves, so I wait it out. 
I FINALLY flag down the guy bussing the table next to ours and he brings us some waters and promises to send the server over. She comes over looking rather (understandably) bedraggled and we very politely put in our order after explaining our situation. She offers no apology and acts as if it's not a big deal. So I'm a little peeved at the lack of reaction. But my pho is on the way and my stomach is growling. 
My beautiful bowl of soup is placed before me and I turn my attention away from the negative experience and grab my chopsticks. And then I see it...gently floating amongst my rice noodles, swimming in my delicious broth without a care in the world is...a...
COCKROACH. 

I stand up, push my bowl away and just point in astonishment and horror. My confused dinner companion sees what I am pointing at and flags down the nearest employee who proceeds to whisk the dish away before I have a chance to gather my wits and take a picture. So now we are both standing at the table trying to figure out what to do. NOBODY comes back over to inquire about us or make amends. So we look at each other, nod and start walking towards the front door. On the way I find our server and take her aside to calmly explain the entire situation and inform her that we are leaving. And I again get a complete non reaction. No apology, no manager. Just an ok and a bewildered stare.

I'm done.",1,0,7

Food was also really good and hit the spot. Although food was good, I think the customer service needs a lot of work and in having the same server too. I would definitely add more stars if the customer service improved, to be honest.
The first time for dine-in, I swear we had 3 different servers come to us and then when we asked about a boba drink to one of the workers there, they looked so lost and confused like they didn't know what boba was and was surprised that it was on their menu.

The host barely even noticed me. He didn't notice me until I asked him for an order to-go... Anyhow, I barely even got to look at the menu he handed me and he already asked me what I wanted, so I just basically ordered what I ordered last time which was chicken chow fun for me and orange chicken with a side of rice for my boyfriend... It took a while, but it was fine, whatever, because it's busy. I went back to the front to wait for my food and like 10 minutes later, the same host who helped me asked me if I had been helped... -_- Anyways, I paid right when the host gave me the receipt, but when my food came out, he brought me back to the cash register and tried to have me pay again. Luckily one of the workers there saw that I paid and said that it was okay.
I finally took the food home and what do you know?! There is HAIR in the orange chicken... Long black hair. Not just one, but two strands... And maybe more. But I just threw the food away...

Pho is solid - can't go wrong with any of the choices.
I also tried the clams in black bean sauce (good), fried mussels (ok) and mayonnaise shrimp with walnuts (good).

They asked if we wanted rice, we said yes. Was charged $3. Wish they said something before we saw it on the check. Plus, most places give you white rice for free if you order mains (I can understand if we just ordered pho).  3 mains (in addition to a pho per person) and I'm charged for rice? I'm big on principle.

It's a good deal compared to 99% of restaurants on the strip (for those visiting) but by the time you add in cab fare round trip, it loses some of its value.

My favorite is their Rare Steak and Brisket soup. The broth is full of flavor. I've tried a lot of different places around Las Vegas but no one has broth like they serve here. 
I also like ordering their spring rolls. It comes with sides of bean sprouts, mint leaves and lime and you wrap it with lettuce leaves. Yummy! 
On our latest visit, we ordered the Japanese noodles. We keep forgetting to order it every-time we come here and finally this time we remembered it before we were already full. It was really scrumptious. No wonder why almost every table we saw had ordered this as well. 
The fish stew was also delightful. The fish was tender and not overcooked. It was saut√©ed with ginger, which gave it a clean flavor. It was so good, I was conflicted whether I wanted to make more room for that or the rare steak pho that I usually order. I ended up eating the former and took the rest of the latter home.

I ordered my usual pho dac biet.  The prices were slightly higher than what I was used to in San Francisco, but it was well worth it.

After a long night out, my cousins and I woke up Saturday morning wanting something to fix that typical Vegas hangover. What else but pho, right?

This spot is located in Vegas's version of Chinatown, located right off the Strip. If you're taking a taxi, make sure you ask your driver for their taxi company's phone number so you have someone to pick you up. It's a frequent spot for taxi drivers, so it shouldn't take too much to describe where you're at.

Ordered the #13, which is basically pho with every type of meat. I don't know, it's not the world's best pho, but if you have the drunchies or need a cure for your hangover, this may as well be the best pho you'll have within the next hour.

Personally, my drunk Yelper self would say that they give a good ratio of noodles to broth. However, my sober and more critical Yelper self would wish there was more meat. But my drunk/hungover Yelper self wins this review.

They're open 24 hours by the way. Pho after the club? You betcha.",4,1,7

However, of course the morning after some heavy drinking out in Vegas, the first thing that comes to a Bay Area native's mind is ""My God... some pho would be the perfect cure right now."" Hence, my cousins and I went on a hunt to find some pho. Funny thing is there is also a ""Pho Kim Long"" where we are from, so we thought we'd give this place a chance. Hopped into a cab and asked the cab driver himself if he had a favorite Pho place. And right off the bat he named this place! 

The restaurant itself is bigger than most pho restaurants I've been to, and definitely the NICEST looking. I'm used to cheap restaurants that look a bit dirty inside. This place actually has ambiance. Service wasn't too shabby as well, and honestly don't know if it was because I was super hungry (and slightly hungover) but I could say this was the best pho I've ever eaten... surprised it was in Vegas! Even my sister's vermicelli salad looked bomb and perfectly proportioned. Be warned as they only have one size and no ""larges"" for you hungry hippos. Or maybe they do, but it's not listed on the menu.

Definitely should open a location on the strip and they'd make so much money. I wiill definitely consider coming back to this place for my hangover cures if I am to return to Sin City.

The Drunken Noodles are awesome....I could def eat that whole plate myself, my boyfriend and I usually order a couple different things, meat plate, veggie plate like buck choy and then pho - we def get into the family style dining.

I got that part but let me think about this for a sec. If I spend $75.00 on two burgers, two orders of fries, and two sodas at the Mirage, I expect my meal to be damn near fantastic. It wasn't though. Yet, everything happens for a reason and I think that reason was to find Pho Kim Long.

After taking a cab ride to a Wells Fargo location to pull some funds out, the cab driver gave the terrific recommendation of this place and I'm so glad he did. What a way to cure a hangover after a long night of drinking!!! This place is amaze-ballzzzz. Just to put things in perspective, I spent $40 for two people (tip included) on:

2 bowls of Pho
2 fresh coconut waters served in the actual coconut
2 iced coffees
1 order of egg rolls

I was mad full afterwards and fully rehydrated afterwards.

Luckily, I entered the restaurant right before their lunch rush so waiting for a table took all of two minutes before they said they had a table ready. During my almost week long stay in Vegas, I think I visited this place about three times and every time it was always full of people. From what I hear, this is the place to be come 4, 5, 6 in the morning but I don't have time for that nonsense. It was perfect at 10:30/11 a.m. for me.

So he said okay and asked if he could have pan fried noodles with chow fun and the waitress still said he wouldn't like it because he isn't Asian and highly recommended him to get chow me in.

So of course, off we go..... 
I must say, it's hard for me to necessarily tell the difference between Pho (broth etc) but SOMETHING about this place just seemed slightly better. Now then that's not to say the others were subpar... Just this one is somehow ... BETTER. 
My wife, whom is some kinda pho semi-pro-am taster expert, confirmed my suspicions by vocally stating over and over how GOOOOOD hers was. 
I don't know the names. I had pho something with brisket. Large. Dumped sriracha in it and went to town. No veggies (onions etc) just meat and noodles and I Jammed out. No hassle from
Waitstaff. 
The wife got Pho Ga. Loved it. Large size. Put it like this... Of all the restaurants I review, she has never actually finished her meal, ever.... She slammed that large bowl, totaled it. That is a testament of how good/legit it was. 
Vegas can get expensive... This place was refreshingly cheap and super delicious. About 3 min drive from circus circus. Parking is a B***h but whatever, circle around until you find one. It's worth it.

Made our way to a strip mall a little off the Vegas strip. Tried the small #15. Pretty decent. Broth was superb but the noodles were a bit off for me. Not horrible though. Can be fixed with the right ratio of siracha, limes, cilantro, bean sprouts, and jalapenos. Began to work my magic and soup was delicious.

Unfortunately I can't seem to agree. The broth is what makes it or break it. It was dingy broth and all I tasted was salt. The meat wasn't fresh and the little amount of noodles that they gave was over cooked. Just didn't do it for me. :(,2,1,10
143219,6oFj7xVWbyP4bldBz4oBYw,FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw,"Seriously, what a disgrace to pho!! If you want less than mediocre pho with awful service, this is definitely the place for you!  

First of all, it's in a plaza with like 90 other stores. And they mostly cater to the Asian community. So imagine a tight parking lot filled with Asian drivers. Yeah, you get the picture. 

Next, it's always so busy in there. There's no room to wait while you get called for a table, so people are forced outside. Fine if it's spring time, crap if it's in the middle of summer or winter. 

There's no warmth in the service. Idk, maybe it's just me, but if I'm going to sit down at a restaurant, I like the server to chat a little. Even just a smile, a ""how are you?"" would be nice. Nope not here. They hurdle you to the table, take your order, bring your food, then your check. Good luck trying to get someone's attention if you need something extra. On my last visit, it took about 10 minutes to waive someone down so I could put in another order to go. I see this place as a fancy fast food pho joint.

Now the food. The egg rolls are pretty typical. They are fried so you can't really mess those up. Pho broth is on the oily side, like you can see the oil floating at the top of your bowl. Noodles are stuck together like they've been waiting in the bowl for broth to loosen them up. My last visit I ordered seafood pho and it was so gross. The seafood was not fresh at all and had a fishy taste. And the squid tasted like it was on the verge of expiring. Their smoothies are pretty tasty, but stay away from the boba. It's mushy at first and they get hard as it sits in your cold drink.

The only thing they have going for them is that they are open way late and can cater to the night crowd of Vegas. I don't eat here by choice, only by the choice of others. I'd much rather drive the few blocks down and eat at Kihn Do.",2,1,5

Ugh, unfortunately, I have to say that the folks that run this place ought to be ashamed of themselves. 

I already had a bad taste in my mouth even before walking in after seeing the large banner advertising that this establishment is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas. 

We waited approximately ten to fifteen minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad after hearing of the epic wait times for a table here. 

It wasn't worth it. The pho was extremely unimpressive, with a cheap tasting, salty broth that rendered my friend and me overly thirsty for the next twelve hours. The rare meat tasted as if it were ""improperly aged,"" as I like to term it, and was not fresh at all. Honestly, if it weren't for the dish's soft tripe, I would have given this place a one-star review. 

The pork chop that my ""aunt"" ordered was greasy and dry at the same time. I didn't think that was possible. It seemed like it had been recooked twice over. 

To add insult to injury, the basic tea was priced western-style at $1 per person. I'm sorry, but this place does not qualify as Asian due to that pricing structure. Tea is part of the dining experience at any formal Asian restaurant. 

The service was cordial but average. 

All of the above being said, if I were to give this restaurant some advice, it would be to remove that silly banner. If you need to advertise that you are the best, it means that you clearly aren't or you already had plans to reduce quality and/or cut costs.",2,0,5

And then when I told the server that I didn't like it, he did take it back but the other waitresses really rude about it.. Busting out loudly saying what is wrong with the calamari that me and my guest heard it from across the room..

Not very good customer service if you ask me.. She then proceeded to our table and asked me personally what was wrong with the calamari and I may have been a little rude but I told her it was disgusting and she got mad and walked off..

I feel like you have to go off the strip in order to get good authentic Asian food, particularly pho. And you will definitely need your pho fix after a night of drinking! It's definitely one of my favorite hang over meals...I loved the flavor of the soup, and the meat quality wasn't sucky like a lot of other places.

Since we had a group of girls, there were a variety of other dishes that were delicious. Since it's been a while, tho, I can't really remember each dish...but here goes:

There was a stir fried udon plate that was really realy good. Actually, it's one of the dishes that we took back to the hotel, to-go...and later had as a midnight snack. I know, gross right? But hey, it was perfectly fine!!! No tummy aches...

We ordered the pea shoots for our veggie dish, and it complemented all the other dishes so well. It really helps to have a veggie dish to go with the meat-y, rich dishes.

The calamari (or maybe it was fried squid?) was nice and crispy, with lots of extra crunchy flakes on top. We probably over ordered here, but at least we got to try a variety of dishes!",5,1,8

Went for dinner with a bunch of friends more recently and the quality was just not there.   I thought it was just okay.  Pho wasn't entirely hot when I got it, which was disappointing. As others have mentioned, some foods taste like they were bought pre-packaged and not made in house. One of my companions is Vietnamese and came from a family of caterers, to boot.  He ripped the place a new one over the food - spices were off, dishes were not done properly, etc.  I was genuinely disappointed as I love all kinds of Asian food and wanted to really like this place.  Unfortunately, I think they've gotten a little big for their britches, they know folks are going to show up no matter what and just are phoning it in now.

We chose this place over the other solely because the name was too awesome to pass up and I couldn't resist a check-in on Facebook.

Everything from our appetizer to the dessert was amazing. We started with the Calamari which my mouth is watering for as I write this review two months later. Very salty but nothing wrong with that! Next up for me was the pho which is hard to screw up but surprisingly some places in Oregon do. It was spot on- perfect flavor. For dessert we had the pineapple half with ice cream. The ice cream could have been served a little but it was still great.

3 dollars for carbonated water! 
we questioned it since nowhere else in AMERICA they charge for Co2 and water, they went to get the manager (which claimed to be the owner). That younger male with an attitude of a major jerk, leaned on the table with both ""fists"" on the table, leaned over into our personal space and asked: whats your problem!

""I don't care if I lose a customer that doesn't want to pay for carbonated water, Its 2.99 and I will not remove it from the bill"" .

Our waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages. How do you just forget an order that you wrote down?

Their cooking is fresh when you order from them, otherwise if you base it off the food they have displayed... it looks dried and old... but surprisingly when you get catering from them... they are hella generous, always give a little more, like free donuts. and when I order tray of lo mein from them... they don't just fill it to the rim... they fill past the rim and pile and pile the noodles in the tray and it's the foil that keeps from spilling out!!! they ain't stingy with servings here.

My friend wanted to order a tofu fried rice. Its not on the menu but since he saw they have some tofu dishes, he thought he could order it. We've been eating out together for years, and everytime he ask for it usually theres no problem. Instead, the waitress look at him like he's dumb and said ""I'm sorry we don't have that on the menu. But I could ask the cook to make veggie fried rice if you want."" Well why can't you ask the cook to make tofu fried rice? Both are not on the menu! Whats so different between those two? He ended up getting fried rice with egg only. He asked for a fried egg on top of the fried rice and again, the server said he CAN'T. The eggs are blended into the fried rice.
Really.. what's the difference??
At this point my friend was pissed off, so he agreed to anything.

Check came out with gratuity included and original tab with chinese writings on it and no english at all. Since none of us read hanzi, we asked a waitress to translate it, which she did, but she saw one of the dish has wrong price (it was written $9.50 instead of $13.50) so she took the tab without saying anything, added $4 to the total price, gave it back to us, and left.

Came here for lunch before leaving Vegas - and obviously not a good one at all.

We were a party of 6 adults and 2 children - we ordered 6 dishes:

House Steamed Chicken with the ginger onion dipping sauce - there were barely any meat on the chicken - quite frankly it was nearly all bones and skin.

Seafood Tofu Pot - this dish was okay 

Soy Sauce Beef Chow Fun - it was like they pour oil all over it before serving it - it was very hard to eat when it's slipping off your fork/chopstick.

Beef Stew Lo Mein with Wontons - the noodles were disgusting! it was soggy and not to mention tasteless. 

Duck Noodle Soup with Wontons - again the noodles were disgustingly soggy...wontons were bland and there was not much meat on the pieces of duck.

Chinese Broccoli sauteed with garlic - pretty greasy and it was definitely very aged broccoli 

They also charge for rice - per bowl..

Normally at the Sam Woo back at home (San Gabriel, CA) ordering 6 dishes for lunch amounts to about 30 dollars - 40 dollars at most but here it was unbelievably 90 dollars!  

The service was just as bad - it wasn't busy but had to ask several times for things plus one of the waitress openly and loudly complained about another table of diners that left - how they asked for utensils but didn't use them.

Whether it's a late night where you don't feel like cooking or if you feel like splurging on your diet, there is always loyal wholesome Chinese food you can rely on. Flavor and exotic taste is the promise of the American Chinese cuisine. Unfortunately ""Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant"" is NOTHING like what was mentioned in the previous sentences. Instead of the familiar tasty Chinese food we all know and love, it was a mashy mish slop of poor cooking and over priced bland food. We had a few dishes, but more than enough to complain about. After a week's trip at Las Vegas we entered this small, dirty establishment in hopes of being greeted with a fine Chinese dining experience. Our hopes were very very wrong.

First we had ordered the Chinese white cut chicken, a salt marinated dish usually served as an appetizer or main meal. This was neither, instead it was an offensive dish to Chinese standards. There was literally no taste as if the cooks just had dumped the chicken in plain boiling water and went off to go do something else half-assed with their weak culinary skills. Several of the dishes after this were also the same, missing on any type of taste whether it was suppose to be a spicy beef cooked with eggplant or pork slices which were really soggy. They eventually served us the ong choy (chinese spinach) we ordered but upon closer observation we could tell that the vegetables were old and withered, all the parts that should be green were a sickly yellow. 

And maybe all of this could had been forgiven if it weren't for the smudgy dirty plastic dishes they used, the lack of a function AC in Las Vegas summer weather and especially the price the put on all of this tasteless food. For only 6 dishes the whole meal cost near $100 dollars! And they already threw in gratuity onto the check even though it was just 5 people eating. I guess this is the only way the waiters could actually make any tips because they seemed to lazily shuffle about and place down your food farthest from your seat. 

Overall this probably is the worst restaurant I have ever been. Definitely the worst chinese restaurant. I'm surprised how this place is still open after all the bad reviews. If these owners of this restaurant had a single shred of pride they'd do something and work toward fixing this dump and horrible imitator of real Chinese American cuisine.",1,1,5

Not once did a waiter or waitress ask if we needed more water, etc.  The only time our waiter forced an unconvincing smile on his face was when it was time to pay the bill.

On the plus side though, the food was pretty good. My family enjoyed the choi sum, chow fun with beef and the fried calamari.

My Sam Woo Hot Pot was simply soy sauce, salt, and a variety of seafood, a few pieces of chicken, and a few of pork. The fish was like wet cardboard (I think it was fish?), the squid was just the body--no tentacles, and there were all of two shrimp.  It was hot, it was in a pot...that part did not lie.

We came in and there was no one to greet us. We wrote our name down and waited for a table. About five minutes later, another family walks in and they get greeted and seated RIGHT AWAY before we even get acknowledged. 

We ordered the wonton noodle soup, beef chow fun, house special chow mein, bean curd tofu, and shredded pork fried rice. And none of it was good. 

The beef chow fun was greasy and bland. The chow mein was soaked in so much sauce that it could've been a soup. If I wanted the soup, I would have ordered it. The seafood that was on the chow mein was small, frozen, and overlooked. Not to mention it was so bland. Let's just say that everything we ordered was greasy, bland, and overall disappointing. 

They also add the tip to your bill. So don't even bother tipping them on the table. Not like it's worth it anyway. Overall, a super disappointing and expensive meal. Never coming back again.",1,0,6

Was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. That's like Jimmy Johns fast.
The drive alone took me nearly 10 minutes because I didn't know where it was- it's easy enough to find though, adjacent to the drive-thru Subway on Decatur. 

Interior of restaurant initially smells like the Subway it's next to- very odd. Service is about what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant with four large tables of Asian families dining on traditional dishes. That is to say, lackluster service. Somehow I even had to ask for chopsticks. I was a little bummed that they didn't include fortune cookies with my check as they did for dine-in customers. Oh well, it was late (almost 10:30).

Got home and was pleasantly surprised by the packaging; the corners of the shrimp balls' styrofoam box were removed to vent so that the condensation didn't build up and make them mushy. And the crispy pan fried noodle was in a box alone, with the accompanying gravy in a lidded soup cup. Genius!

Plated the noodles and gravy, and BF tore in. It was super, super hot (temperature) despite getting there a little late and making the trek home. Hot and delicious, though I prefer a few more veggies than I got. The shrimp balls though, were legit. Small and crispy and shrimpy and tasty, with a cup of that pinkish red sauce that wasn't too ketchuppy but just right.

The food has not only stayed at the same quality but the portions have to and to my amazement the prices havent gone up too much. Food Express kills most places in China town when it comes to the quality and taste of their food. Every item we ordered was so fresh and full of flavor. Hell even the mushu appatizer was the best i have had.Then you add in that it's almost half the price of every place in China town. It's a no brainer Food Express best Chinese resteraunt in town hands down. Your doing yourself a true injustice if you haven't been here.

The food is authentic and tasty and they don't put their thumbs on the scale.  We always order a pound and a half of live shrimp and its often larger than other chinese restaurants' two pound orders.  The crab in salt and pepper is always exceptional.  I personally really enjoy the hong kong crispy noodles and the salt and pepper pork chops.  

Yeah, its not in a great area (near the swap meet), but its well worth the drive.

The prices seem to be in the average for the Chinese food industry here in Vegas.

They have a menu for a quick lunch plate or, you can dine in for Family style dining.

I don't want to judge to harshly but I know my 808 peoples from Hawaii may not like this Americanized version of chinese food.

So, here's what a group of us locals from the islands ordered:

Gau Gee [Potstickers] : umm, obviously it was the frozen brand you can find in the asian section of most grocery stores. Pan Fried.

Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings: definitely the rockstar of our meal - because there were 9 of us, we order 4 portions! :)

Orange Chicken : it was like eating Chicken tenders in Orange Sauce with Orange segments as garnish, very basic and simple presentation.

Mongolian Beef: This was good - definitely give this one a thumbs up.

Hong King Style Short Ribs: Skip this one - nothing like how it's supposed to be, instead you get a breaded version of pork spare ribs drowned in sweet and sour sauce.  Just order the regular sweet and sour pork and save yourself the trouble of having to bite into bones and cartilage.

Deep fried Chicken - Half Order : Just like its name. Needed ketchup...

Pan Fried Noodles [Beef & Seafood] - Both selections were pretty good.

Egg Drop Soup: Egg Drop Soup - 'Nuff Said :)

The waitstaff are friendly and pretty attentive, you do have to request the Chinese Hot mustard and chopsticks, our waiter was smiling and knew we weren't from the states, he stated only people not from the states order those items.

I gave 4 stars because the Family Dining experience was a nice laid back atmosphere, the food portions are adequate, and the look and feel of the restaurant was typical of its kind and clean.

However, I felt the food was pretty average - but for some dishes, not in a positive way.

I would definitely come back for the wings when I have wing cravings, but I think this is and will be, a onetime stop for my O'Hana and I.",4,1,5

I was with a group of six so when the bill was brought to the table we added a 20% tip and divided by six.  We each contributed the appropriate amount in cash and triple checked for accuracy.  The busboy came and took the tray with the $168 in cash.  Shortly afterward our waiter returned to the table and slammed the tray down, accusing use of not leaving him a tip. His voice was was so loud patrons at surrounding tables turned to view the scene.  When we explained we had left him a substantial tip he all but called us liers.  No matter how we explained what we thought had happened,  the waiter refused to believe us and continued treating us rudely.

Only because I have had better Chinese in LA. The food was good, service was kind of slow today. Took 10 mins to get our Check.

My wife loves the honey walnut shrimp. Pretty much everything is good, but I always go in expecting to try something new, but I cannot get away from the enormous, moist, flavorful, crisp oysters served on a bed of lettuce with a dish of salt. Incredible. Another winner is the crispy duck, perfectly prepared. Since I am having the oysters I order the duck to take home for another meal. If someone or Yelp didn't tell you about this place you would pass it right by. Do yourself a favor. One of my favorite restaurants in the world.",5,0,6

While trying to order take out for us, the server was kind of rude to him for no apparent reason, so don't come here expecting good service or anything. Not that this place is nice either because it's tiny and literally a hole in the wall. I'm really glad we got our food to go instead of eating here!

The food was aight...been to Chinese places that give a lot bigger portions though, even if it's a lunch special. The Mongolian beef I got was mostly green onion and other veggie fillers and not much beef. The fried rice tasted almost like white rice with grease and veggies in it, but the spring roll was surprisingly good. Lunch specials run Monday through Fridays 11 am to 3 pm and range from $5.95 to 6.25 depending on what you order. It's a pretty good deal but I hope you like lots of veggies!

Not sure if I'll come back again, perhaps...definitely can see why it's not located on Spring Mountain because nobody would go",3,0,4

First we sat down and asked for iced tea he brought us hot tea and said it's complimentary. Ok cool can I still have a iced tea. He said no so I laughed and said can I have some ice then and was told no agian.  Wth anyways I was just thinking well whatever at least I know the food is good so I order the honey walnut shrimp.  So it came out and it was a small portion for 12.95 and soggy.  Oh ya and had just tasted like it was tosed in mayo no honey. Well needless to say they lost my business.,2,1,8

150332,ktwi_xZXVAMUy3MhnZ4bAQ,pj0vl4DIlDCChe80Df40Yw,"So, howe has this place been over the years? I have decided to come back here to try out some of my favorites.  Most of the food is still very, very good, and I highly recommend this place if you want authentic cantonese food.

A.  Steamed Flounder - Steamed fish is an essential add to any true cantonese meal and this flounder was enjoyable, with the right amount of fish sauce, cilantro and onions to give it a nice taste. Would have been AWESOME if the fish was fresh and not frozen. 

B.  Salt Pepper Pork Chops - Served with fried jalepenos.  I found this to be very good overall, not outstanding but good!

C.  Steamed Pork with Salted Fish - Ah, this is a real tasty dish and I also enjoyed this one

D.  Half Chicken with Green Onion and Ginger - Met my expectations. tender, on the bone meat that is very tasty in a natural way. No overpowering flavors at all.

E.  Beef with Bitter Melon - Mom used to serve this to me all the time and I hated it. I love it now and if a restaurant has this on the menu, you can be assured that it is an authentic place. Here it was very good.

F.  Pea Pod with Garlic - Yep, this is not your Bok Choy or Broccoli. this is Pea Pod saut√©ed in Garlic and it is kind of like Spinach. 

G.  Oyster Sauce Chinese Broccoli - Had to order this as the kids always love it. This is prepared the way my mom and grandmother prepared it all those years.

The food here is truly authentic, and so I cannot tell you or rate how their fried rice, chow mein, wonton soup, orange chicken or any other normal type of chinese food is. I went right for the down and dirty normal food I had growing up and was not disappointed.

Why the downgrade? 

1. No other Chinese people in the place other than the waiters.
2. Nearly empty for the longest time.
3. Did not automatically serve us the ""soup of the day"" which for some of you may look like dishwater but is actually a very light double boiled pork bone soup with bits of veggies in it that is the best. Real places always serve the soup as a free appetizer.
4.  Took away our soup bowls and only had plates and forks. Hello, if you are having the Half Chicken, the Steamed fish and the Beef with Bitter Melon, all these dishes have a sauce on them that the rice absorbs oh so well and you can only eat rice properly with a bowl and chopstick.... Why set us up with plate and fork. Must be what their normal clientele use? No respectable place makes you ask for the bowl and chopstick....
5.  Prices are a few dollars higher than i would imagine.

I do like this place and consider it a solid choice to go for the most authentic cantonese food.",4,1,6

150347,t2WZhmFRjwVaiTxO-5OgPQ,MI0OfnmlfkUh2xPhT1lQSg,"Short: Pass on it, go to Krazy Buffet or any other place. Sub-average food, bad service, terrible atmosphere.

I dropped by here because I felt a little tired of the other asian buffets I visit, and it was in the neighborhood. $6.48 for lunch for one. I walked in and was sat down promptly, but that was about it for service other than plate pick up. Crappy decorations--a staple of low-scale asian buffets--but absolutely no music playing to drown out the coughing, children's cries and random conversation. It felt like I was eating in a run-down restaurant on the side of a highway.
Food was cooked at least.... It's the typical spread you'll see at any other buffet, just not as good. All sauces were watered down to the point that one tasted like all the others. I'd guess that half of the selection of ""hot"" food was previously frozen, and the other half showed that it wasn't made very well. Half of the buffet is made up of soups, the worse of deserts, fruit and a pretty bad ""Mongolian BBQ"" side-bar. I wasn't tempted to try the sushi--though I typically risk it.


Bottom line: If you've been to an asian buffet before, this place will disappoint you. It's one of the worse I've been to, and I see no reason why someone should go here when there's a dozen others that are better in this city.",2,1,8

We wound up here after the wait at another spot was much too long. For less than seven bucks you can't go wrong. It is what it is. Low cost, mediocre food in enormous quantities is what you are anticipating, right?

There was literally no wait and we were seated immediately. That's about where three stars ends and two stars begins. There was no broccoli beef, but a small amount of broccoli chicken. They did offer both egg rolls and spring rolls with some of the hottest mustard I've ever had. The cheese wontons were surprisingly good, as were the BBQ pork skewers. Well, the one skewer that was left anyway. We never saw another skewer and were there close to an hour.

I wasn't expecting top shelf dining at a Chinese buffet.  However, I was expecting to eat as much as I wanted. How can you when they don't have any food out? It was as if they were getting ready to close and didn't want to put out more food. This was 12:30 in the afternoon. It's lunch time for crying out loud and we are hungry. 

The service was decent, as was the food we could actually get ahold of. I have to go with two stars for the simple fact that a buffet should have food or at least make an effort to fill it up when it runs empty. Save yourself the two dollars and drink water, as the price does not include a beverage. I will probably give it another shot and update the review if it warrants a different rating.",2,1,10

From the aroma as you walk in, the noise of all the restaurant patrons present, to the hustling servers, the atmosphere altogether is chaotic and amusing at the same time, and I like a little chaos.

The food encompasses many popular asian particulars and a wonderful selection of seafood fare. There is also a made to order stir fry chef for those who would like exclusive specialty dishes.

The dessert bar is simple maintaining a variety of ethnic pastries, cookies, fruit and jello molds.

For you soup lovers, there's a vareity of four options,  focusing on the more popular ones often typical in any American Chinese menu.

Good food, perfect for family or friends to gather and enjoy some easy ready chinese or American fare, definitely stop by.

If I was to recommend anything from the buffet line-here are my fave picks:

Char Sui Roasted Pork
Chicken Wings
Mongolian beef,
Pan fried pot stickers (Gyoza)

I've tried the sesame and orange chicken and thought it was good, not like Chinatown in NYC but still worthy of a mention. The chicken is well cooked and seasoned. The fried rice is much better than what I'm used to. It's not all that greasy. The eggroll isn't special, but spring rolls are always the better option anyways. I would consider this to be one of the better Chinese food places I've been to. Not amazing but you get what you pay for.",3,0,8

First off, I will digress. I learned a lot about Chinese food this weekend. Chopstix is noteworthy for serving ""east coast"" style chinese. I am from the midwest, so I was intrigued. Apparently ""east coast"" style chinese is more Americanized. Its more heavy sauce based/ deep fried based than your average ""west coast"" chinese. I definitely found out after eating at Chopstix that I love east coast chinese food haha. I had always wondered why chinese food in Vegas left me so unsatisfied, and its because they are so different on the two coasts! Who would have thunk?

Delivery was fast and the food was still hot. Everything we ordered was prepared very well and had lots of flavor. The thing we liked most was the value. We got enough food for 3 meals each for about $10 per person. This place is now one of my favorite for chinese in vegas.",4,1,10

If you call to complain about it you will be told what the average tip is for your building and how you are ' too cheap'. Also if you put your tip on a credit card via their on line ordering and not on the slip in front of the driver , the drivers don't understand that  and think you are giving them nothing, and pitch an even bigger fit.  Dinner and a show!

As mentioned in my previous review, this place used to be SWAMPED. When I finally returned, it was virtually empty. Unable to resist sampling their changes, I proudly present my updated 1-star review.

I ordered what they used to be famous for: xiao long bao. It came out lukewarm as though it was microwaved. There was no soup in the dumpling, and the meat was very tough. One of the worst xiao long bao's I've ever had, to be quite frank.

Next on my list was the salty rice roll. This was excellent, and I give them full marks for this. However, it's such a banal dish that it's really child's play.

Finally I had the spicy chilled cucumbers. This was absolutely awful. When prepared properly, the spicy sauce is hot and addicting and delicious. When made incorrectly, however, it's just like mixing a cold vegetable with tons of hot sauce. It won't taste good.

152587,#NAME?,Tigw_9LXyHL63Eu3XAXwRw,"This is one of the few times where Yelp reviews have let me down... because I LOVED the food here. I came here reluctantly because of the low rating, but my Aunt really wanted to eat some Szechuan cuisine while we were in Las Vegas. But maybe my low expectations were a good thing, because I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.

Here's the breakdown!

*Food:
-Pork intestine in clay pot: SO yummy!! This was flavored with a sour and spicy sauce, it was really delicious and the intestine was cooked perfectly. It didn't taste too pungent and it had the right amount of softness. 

-Sizzling rice dish: Delicious. The sauce was sweet and savory, and I loved how it complimented the texture of the crispy rice. One of my favorites from what we ordered.

-Eggplant with garlic sauce: Cooked to perfection! It had the right amount of spice and sweetness and the eggplant was soft with a bit of crisp on the skin.

-Szechuan beef: This was okay. You get A LOT of beef, but it was just all spice and salt and lacked that extra pinch of flavor to take it to the next level.

*Service: It was a little slow because there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant. He was pretty nice and accommodating when he was serving us, but we had to flag him down sometimes. 

*Price: Pretty cheap. Around $10-12 for each dish, which is not bad for dinner.

*Ambiance: The restaurant is pretty spacious, however, some of my dishes weren't very clean prior to eating and I had to switch them out. But that's pretty typical of most Chinese restaurants, so it wasn't a big deal. 

So this is one of the few times where I'm just going to have to disagree with the majority on Yelp. The food is great here and they know how to cook most Szechuan dishes just right. 

*They also offer free wifi inside!!! What Chinese restaurant does that? MAJOR plus!!",4,1,10

We checked with server and asked about the wine specials and were advised, no, they were 2.99. Still a great deal, wine for all!

The place was packed, the 6 of us ordered our entrees and were told it would be awhile as they are busy. Within 5 mins, one meal came out, 5 mins later, the next and so it went for 5 entrees.

One of our group ordered combo fried rice, which finally came out 15 mins or so after our last served entr√©e. They should call this ""fried rice"" white rice with peas. Looked awful, boring and bland. The taster confirmed this was the case. As was the case with the tofu meal ordered by someone else.

Garlic eggplant was good, lo mein was good also.

The kicker came with the bill, three glasses of wine $14.98. Also on the bill, 3 side orders of rice, which were not ordered or received.
I call the owner over and advise we were not charged correctly as the wine should be 1.99 according to webpage or even 2.99 as confirmed by the waiter. Well, this woman just screamed, ""website old, not good prices, new owner, no you pay this price!!"" on and on. When we advised the waiter stated 2.99, she then yelled at him, handed me back the bill and said ""no, pay this thank you"".

Really?? 

Then, as we were leaving after paying the bill , she comes and says ""give us another chance, we will give you free dessert next time and we will change the website"". I think not madam.

There are plenty of good places to eat in Chinatown, this place is not one of them.

From their website: Apparently, you pay what they say, regardless of what is advertised.

This week we were looking for a chinese restaurant in the Las Vegas Chinatown area and found this place.  We should have been wise and not bothered when we only saw a few people in the restaurant for dinner.

There seem to be only a chinese lady(I think the owners wife) working all aspects of the restaurant.  She was taking orders, getting drinks, cleaning table, etc.  She was all over the place which had us waiting.  Needless to say the serve was extremely poor.  The food we ordered was even worst.  No flavor, no taste.  One of our crispy fish dishes was not crispy and was very soft.  We told her the problem but she didn't care.  Please save your money and go somewhere else.  Panda express is way better than this place. By the way, the owner was having dinner and never bothered to help her, even when more people arrived.  Stay far away from this restaurant.",1,1,9

Trust me, it is NOT often that I write a one-star, you have to be truly horrendous to get a one-star from me. Well, truly horrendous is the perfect description for Emperor's Garden. 

Firstly, I didn't pick the place, my traveling book club met there. Being Asian, I tried to be open-minded about it, as none of my Asian Yelpie friends seem to dig this place. I  was pleasantly surprised when I walked in to see it wasn't Americanized at all, actually it's smack in the middle of Chinatown, and the place is just as run-down and stinky as the rest of it (this is not an insult)!

The place was packed with Chinese people, a tour company had taken over the place for dinner. Why would Chinese people from China would want to eat here? I have no idea. Maybe the horrendous service reminded them of home? 

The food was mediocre to bad. The highlight of the night was the eggplant, it was decent. I got the combination fried rice, which was bland and simple, cooked more in the true Taiwanese style than the American style. I tried the Seafood Lo Mein, which was decent, again bland, as authentic lo mein is, but not enough seafood. Nothing about the food wowed me, 3-stars at best. 

The one-star is because of the horrible service. The place has a full bar and someone in my party mentioned that house wine was $2 a glass. What a deal! She had even mentioned it to the waiter, specifically asking if the glass was $2, and he mumbled something like, ""yes, we have it, but it's $3."" The other lady at my table said, ""I would like the $5 glass of wine, NOT the house wine."" Soooo...  the wine comes, and just for fun, everyone tried the $2 wine (I swear it was the two-buck chuck they sell at Trader Joe's) then we tried the $5 wine. IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME! But we laughed it off. We were having fun and the lady didn't seem to mind paying the extra $2.

The bad service came when we got the bill. They charged everyone $5 for a glass of wine. When we complained, the OWNER said that's the price and we have to pay. WTF??? We even pulled up the website to show that the house wine was $2 and we specifically asked when we ordered. The OWNER said that it wasn't her website and she would not honor the price. LOL. Well, the address was the same? The name of the restaurant was the same? I guess someone with a huge vendetta against this place took it upon themselves to make a fake website and sell glasses of wine for $2. HAHAHA. What a bunch of bullcr@p. And the OWNER was getting nasty about it, she was so upset we weren't going to pay the extra $2! Her restaurant was packed, we just rang up a $200 bill and she was upset over the $2! 

So we did what every vindictive 'Murican does, we took it out of the tip. LOL. Duuuuh... The OWNER then had the audacity to tell us if we come back, we can have a free dessert. Uh... no. 

They also padded our bill with things we didn't order, like bowls of rice and something else.... but they promptly took it off. 

Overall.... just a miserable experience in a stinky rundown place. Will not come back.",1,0,1

Do you know what's worse than losing money in Vegas? The answer is coming here for Taiwanese style breakfast  ...

I don't even know why I came here in the first place, but our group saw the word ""Yong He Soybean Milk"" (Ê∞∏ÂíåË±ÜÊºø) and the rest is history. ""Yong He Soybean Milk"" symbolizes a famous Taiwanese breakfast restaurant and everyone nowadays just abuses its name. Breakfast is available from 8 AM to 2 PM.

There was only one server at 8 AM and he doesn't seem to speak English, but at least he speaks fluent Mandarin (errr ....... yay)! 

Soy Sauce Flavored Soybean Drink (""Salty"" Soy Milk, $3.25): ""Salty"" soy milk is one of those Taiwanese breakfast item not everyone would love. It contained vinegar, Chinese oil stick (youtiao), sesame oil, and some green onion. Emperor's Garden version of ""salty"" soy milk was a bit disappointing. (2/5)

Shrimp & Chicken Wan Ton Soup ($9.95) - Wow ... $10 wonton soup. I would THINK all food items here would be pretty cheap because we are in the middle of Chinatown. Tasted really whatever and $10 price tag didn't help. (2/5)

Chinese Style Egg Taco (Taiwanese egg pancake, $4.5): One of the most tasteless Taiwanese egg pancake I've had ever. (1/5)

What a terrible experience! They used to be pretty good a few years back - but trust these reviews, as this place has really changed!! 

Came here over Christmas break 2014 with the family. Being from the Bay Area, we know what a good Taiwanese breakfast entails, and this place is far from it. It was way overpriced as well.

What we ordered:
Salty soymilk: Tasted bland and flavorless. 
Sweet cold soymilk: Way too sweet. Lukewarm, not cold. And $2.85 for a glass of sweet cold soymilk? Average nowadays should be $1.50, maybe $2. 
Egg taco: Edible, but just some plain eggs around a flat pancake. Quite boring. Didn't even have green onions.
Mixed noodles (ÊãåÈù¢): Where are the noodles?? Barely any noodles on the bottom of the bowl with some strings of cucumber. Not worth the $7.95 at all!
Spicy beef pancake (ÁâõËÇâÂ§æÈ§Ö). The beef was OK, but the pancake was hard and tasteless. Not at all fluffy the way it should be.

The final kicker; they add a mandatory 15% tip. WHAT?? I've only known fancy Western restaurants to do that, and even then it's only at dinner time. They must be losing business and is desperate to try and get whatever they can from their customers. No one's coming back again anyway, I guess there's no harm in ripping that extra tip from them now.",1,0,7

The sweet and sour chicken was made with dark meat and precooked. The fried rice was excellent. I sent back the sea bass and was given the explanation of ""this is how it's made"", with an attitude. I asked for beef and broccoli instead. It was delish. As we the service, we were approached and asked for the entire order. We had not even looked at the menu.

As this is a family style restaurant, we wanted to get around 6 - 7 items to share amongst each other. The entrees we got were;

Peking Duck: probably one of their best things here, good sized duck, lots of meat, very crispy skin, comes with the white bun and colorful shrimp chips, wasn't overly salty. 
BBQ Combination Platter 1/2 size: This was my favorite along with the duck, I probably would have just gone with the full order and just taken off something else we ordered, the dish comes with fried chicken, jelly fish, pork loaf slices, meat loaf slices, and cha shu pork. 
Honey Walnut Shrimp: Disappointing portion size, there was literally like 7 pieces of shrimp on there.....for $16 bux? Man we got jipped hard, I probably would recommend putting that money into a different dish.
Clams in vermicelli special broth: clams were good but the broth wasn't that special, it was sort of bland, but it was different than the usual ways people order clams at Chinese restaurants.
Steamed Egg plant with garlic sauce: Wasn't really garlic sauce, more like just sauteed egg plants with crushed garlic sprinkled on top, so technically, it needed some sauce.
Yang Chow Fried Rice: decent, no real complaints from this, probably need some more salt.
Pan Fried Chinese Broccoli: probably our only real healthy dish, it was good, nothing memorable from it, but we did finish it.

Overall, this restaurant is a decent Chinese joint.",3,0,5

We were promptly greeted and seated - right under a TV airing Glee, and a speaker playing Top 40 from the 90s. A few people were seated in our section after we were...all American. The Asians were seated on the opposite side of the restauraunt. 

We weren't offered any chopsticks...because we are American.

152824,6WlAKs8hcV3SLwoNZcoeUQ,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"Well, first off, we found that Chinatown in Las Vegas is nothing like Chinatown in San Francisco. It is a bunch of shops and mini-malls spread out along about a two-mile stretch of Spring Mountain Road, west of the I-15.

Joyful House has been listed as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas, but in my opinion it's not THE best. 

My wife and I and two high-school girls from Shanghai tried it out the other afternoon for an early dinner, and they, at least, seemed to think the food was somewhat authentic. We started out with bowls of West Lake Egg Flower Chowder, which I thought was somewhat bland. Adding a small amount of chili paste and a splash of shoyu (soy sauce) helped.

They ordered steamed chicken with ginger and mustard greens with mushrooms, but didn't seem to eat much of the greens. My wife and I tried the Pan Fried Spinach with Garlic, Barbecued Pork Fried Rice and Chicken Chow Fun. The latter actually wasn't much fun, as the noodles turned out to be really thick and hard to handle. We should have ordered the skinny noodles instead. I thought the fried rice was very good. 

Serving sizes here are huge, so we had the leftovers boxed up and we found a couple of homeless guys down the street who really appreciated them.

We could have ordered a bit less and still fed one homeless person, but we got out the door for $95 (including tip) and thought it was quite a bit better than the typical Chinese place.",4,1,8
152825,jobgh9xFD_rgxZ3WlsF_VA,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"Not too good, not too bad.  My husband and I ordered the salt & pepper calamari, clams in black bean sauce and sesame chicken.  The calamari was pretty good, a little overrated but came out nice and crispy w/ salt and red pepper seasoning and some sliced Serrano peppers that were hella spicy.  The clams in black bean sauce wasn't that good, the sauce was super salty (we ordered it after reading all the rave reviews on it).  The sesame chicken was good, it's our safe go to dish whenever we eat Chinese food.  Our bill came out to $47.24 including a HongKong iced tea that was never refilled, a little disappointing since it cost $3.75.  Perhaps I'm just cheap but I'm used to paying $2.50~ for iced tea w/ unlimited refills.  Another disappointment was the cleanliness, lots of dust on the wood window sills along the restaurant.  Makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.  Better get to cleaning before Darcy Spears hits them up and they end up on Action 13 new's Dirty Dining!  Eeeks.",2,1,3

The Peking duck was a bit disappointing as the skin was not as flavorful and crispy and the man who filleted the skin did not do a very good job. There were uneven pieces but nevertheless, we got to have Peking duck. The claypots were okay. The sauce was a bit heavy. The stir-fried A vegetables was the best!

The broth of Seafood Wor Wonton Soup was quite flavorful, and the filled wontons very memorable, but a scary-looking Calamari, tough scallops, and inferior pork made the soup a story of contrasts.  Average-sized pan-fried Potstickers were good and I received my several requested condiments of sliced ginger, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Potsticker Sauce with onions, Hoisin Sauce, and Hot Chili Oil without any difficulty, and Shrimp-Fried Rice with carrots and peas was very good.  

Beef & Snow Peas with Black Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce was a sumptuous Cantonese dish, and Kung Pao Chicken had a nice level of controlled heat.  Service by the well-trained and disciplined staff was consistently on the ball and responsive to needs.

Where else can you order Geoduck and not too many places offer Abalone. I do note that these are very high end luxury seafood items and do cost around $60. $70. a portion. They also have a variety of many reasonably priced fresh fish dishes and daily specials. Free range chicken is also on the menu. (I've never seen that at any other Chinese Restaurant).

We ordered the Sweet Corn Soup for two. Actually the portion is enormous and can feed 4-6 people. It's delicious and anyone would enjoy it. Our waitress offered us a hot chili sauce and soy sauce condiments with the soup.

I had to try the Braised Tofu with Bamboo Fungus. (I think it cost around $12.00) The presentation isn't good but the dish actually tasted good. Bamboo Fungus is actually a veil from a mushroom grown in Asia. It really has almost no flavor on it's own but does have a most interesting delicate texture and is suppose to be extremely beneficial to your health. Under the Tofu and Bamboo Fungus was a large pile of fresh Chinese Broccoli.

The Special of the day was Whole Flounder for $23.00 so we ordered one fried and it was served  de-Boned Table side.

They don't have any lunch specials on the weekends or a lunch menu for that matter, so we had to order 1 plate of honey walnut shrimp from the dinner menu (even though it was 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon). 

Honey Walnut Shrimp with Mayonnaise $16.50 -- The portion was small (10 med/small sized shrimp) the shrimp tasted very fishy and like they were frozen, also barely gave us any walnuts. We did not enjoy this dish at all. KJ kitchen's version costs less, gives you more shrimp, and gives a ton more walnuts. 

Their rice was dry and tasted dirty. Not sure how a legitimate Chinese restaurant can mess this up? 

I was shocked they didn't have the real deal homemade authentic sat√© chili sauce in oil. They brought out the commercial bright red sambal oelek from a bottle which tasted weird and not spicy at all. Very disappointing.

152866,hzBWuoev8PWWYzj17I-AIA,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"I generally agree with yelp but in this case the 265 other reviewers are dead wrong. The food was bbbllllannnndddd as hell. No spices or sauces on the table, not even chop sticks. The meat was fatty and cheap, the noodles plainly sucked and were flavorless and the whole meal was pretty pricy as well. 
If we wanted super white washed Asian food we could have stayed on the strip but dating an Asian has it's drawbacks as she needs to eat Asian food at least once a day.  All I heard all night was how awful that place was and how the owner brings shame to his family by serving such terrible cuisine..",2,0,8

Based on their location, you would think it's some bomb authentic Chinese food, WRONG again. It was the most flavorless food you could put in your mouth.  Money, not well spend. Overpriced. Note to Owner: Please rename your business to AWFUL HOUSE FAKE CHINESE CUISINE.  I am giving it a one star, because yelp made me do it, in order to comment.

Strolling in with Ricardo A for a bite to eat on a Saturday night, we realized quickly that no reservations were required. 

As soon as we walked in we were seated very quickly with menus and hot tea. At the start of the menu there is 3 dinner servings with a easy simple courses if you don't want to think to hard or simply are not sure what you want.

I selected the number 1 serving. With soup, massive plate fried rice and another plate with noodles. I can't 100% tell you what was in all the dishes but I can tell you they were pretty good with a decent serving.

Joyful house has a great seafood selection with a lot of  live crabs and lobsters swimming in the tanks on the rear wall. Although a speciality I didn't get to try any. But with other yelpers reviews it shows that it maybe something worth coming back to.

The decor of Joyful isn't a 5 star restaurant that you would find in a fancy strip casino, but what it does bring to the table is good food and prompt service.

Service: 4-5
Food: 5-5

I suggest to ""just pick any place...    I'm sure it will either be Awesome or it will at least be a story""...       Now the sound of screeching tires...   a wild left turn from the right lane and we were there...    at Joyful House.

Once we thanked the gods that we were still alive...  we checked the yelp reviews...      a lot of them... and a really good average.  Alright, looking forward to this.

So the place is kinda what I was hoping for...     something that didn't look like a high over-head ""Asian Fusion"" type place like PF Changs (all do respect to PF...   I do love the Mongolian beef)...   it's simple and to the point...    kinda like a dinner.  Think denny's.   We got seated right away and menus came out to us...   we started looking at stuff but noticed that on the first page were three combo set dinner options...   we made it easy and ordered option 1...( We are not picky...  no food allergies...     we were just hungry)

Oh My God...    Come HUNGRY

Out comes tea...     that's cool...   then a very large bowl of soup...Sooooo tasty.   

Next egg rolls, dumplings, and other assorted fried goodies.....     MMmmmmmmm

Ok now rice.   Not a little but a huge plate of the rice along with chicken chow mien...     man...    there was a lot of food....  but wait there's more

Two more huge family style plates of noodles and sweet and sour chicken.   Table now covered in food...  and good food.   We ate and we ate but alas...   we barely ate half of it.    

Listen if you're looking for the Vegas Strip style place...   this is not your place.   If you want to be seated and fed in a relaxed, local and unpretentious place, then give this a shot.   

I've read some of the other reviews about the bland food and what not and I feel bad for those people that they had a bad experience.    Clearly they came on an off day because what we got was great....     

Now I just need to go and digest....

152883,3vqrERh-7YAxwmZcgftBag,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"I remember coming here years back when they used to be in a different location (I think, can't remember that far back...).  I also remember that it was quite good, although I again cannot remember at all what I had.  I'm sure they were fairly typical dishes such as mushu or kung pao or something.  Recalling that they were good and being in the mood for Chinese, we made our way here for lunch.

First of all, no lunch menu on weekends.  We got the menu of dozen pages or so that were just normal dinner dishes - fairly expensive dishes.  Fortunately we were not looking for a lunch menu and wanted the full gamut so it didn't faze us any, but be prepared that it will not be a cheap lunch.  The menu you do get is upscale in both the menu itself and the contents with right balances of seafood and non-seafood.  

I was craving some Chinese seafood so we ordered the Seafood Wor Wonton Soup ($10), marinated spicy clams ($14), and sweet & sour crispy rock cod fish ($14).  The soup had plenty of fat wontons and ample amount of seafood, and with the large size it's well worth the price.  Spicy clams were in deep red, spicy sauce, with a hint of mala tingliness.  Loved it.  The sweet & sour was not too sweet, not too sour, with perfectly fried fish that was as tender as can be.  As good as the first two were, this was even better.  With enough unusual items on the menu, this may very well be our go-to Chinese.

Our meal came to $50 after all was said and done, but it was the best Chinese we've had in a long, long time.  Service was more pleasant than the typical Chinese restaurants, although it's all relative.  Food came fast, restaurant is clean, and traffic was brisk.  I'm torn between 4 & 5-stars, but let's leave it at 4 until I revisit.  It's really 4.5 stars.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Despite the large table-centric set up, I think the atmosphere might actually work for 1.  Maybe.",4,0,10
152884,0_8Dl3_SHoomlAL0DhmcoA,zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg,"This stand alone building on Spring Mountain road may not look like much from the outside, but once you step inside you might feel underdressed. With white linens and waiters dressed in suits, it's got an upscale vibe. But, most of the customers seemed to be dressed as casually as me. 

Their menu is massive. It's a large book full of items that will satisfy those looking for authentic fare and those looking for Chinese-American food -- the kind you can get from any corner take out spot.

Kung pao chicken was heavy on sauce, but a decent portion size with plenty of chicken, green peppers and nuts. Shrimp fried rice was light on ingredients (other than rice) but the flavors were solid. If you're a fan of bok choy, the mushroom and bok choy dish had just enough sauce to let the ingredients shine while enhancing their flavors. My favorite dish of the night was the tender, well seasoned beef in oyster sauce with green onions. I loved the flavors of the sauteed green beans, too with it's subtle use of heat and minimal amounts of oil. If fish is your thing, try the seabass. Flakey and delicate, it was a well executed dish with a light buttery flavor. Not as successful was the house fried half chicken. The skin was perfectly wafer thin and crispy, but the meat was bland and dry as a bone.

Perfect for large parties, it's also great for families. Kids will love the aquariums full of crabs, lobsters and other future meals.",4,1,10

Not the kind of chow mein from a cheap, take-out place but the real stuff. I searched Chinese food in my Yelp app and Joyful House came up first on the results. The reviews had me sold, so we jumped in the car and drove across town for a midnight snack. 

The parking lot was a little dark, but it was expected since it was so late and everything else in that little shopping center was closed. The restaurant had about two tables filled, now three once we all sat down. Must be a good place if there are people here eating Chinese food instead of on the strip at midnight. We ordered soft noodles, salt and pepper pork, minced beef with tofu and sizzling beef (came on a hot plate). All of the food arrived at the table family style and freshly made-- just what I was craving for! It was delicious and I would definitely come back again. I especially like how late the Joyful House stays open and how accommodating the service was. Our drinks were never empty and our server brought more rice the moment I scarfed it all down. We definitely felt welcomed, even when it was probably past our server's bed time (and mine, too!) 

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who might be visiting Las Vegas and craves some authentic Chinese food-- not that greasy chow mein from a fast food chain or the 'meh' broccoli and beef from a tray at a casino buffet.

The only person who communicated and provided some positive attention was the non-Asian bus boy, or maybe he was a waiter-in-training.  

It was a quiet night so several waiters stood a few feet from our table surveying the empty tables.  Guess they had nothing else to do; they stared at times and never said a word or cracked a smile.  

They should remove the ""Joyful"" name from their business and replace with ""Me-No-Smile Chinese Restaurant.""

I finally decided to try Ocha's version for lunch with some friends based on the photos I saw.

First of all the restaurant is huge. It was actually pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated promptly and there was one server. 

The price points are average for Thai food in Vegas. The dishes were on average $11-$12 which is okay. There's some cheaper places and some more expensive.

The place wasn't so nice inside as the table was all beat up with some sharp areas you'll have to be careful of.

We got pad thai which was good but nothing special. Not the best but most the worst. On the plus side it did stay nice and moist. 

We got Thai beef salad which was okay. It really just tasted like it was dressed with lime juice. It was really one note. There was pretty much just lettuce and some beef slices. 

Last we got the Tom Kha Gai. It was not good. I know that Laos and Thai people all make it different and I've had this soup many times. I've heard of the sour flavor from the soup coming from lime or tamarind. This place definitely used tamarind and it was super sour and super salty. You couldn't taste any spice just salt and sour. The portions of chicken and mushroom in here were generous though. I can't say that about the pad Thai or beef salad though.

My two positives were that they gave us a generous serving of white rice & I believe the sticky rice was on the house. That reminds me their rice was not good. Sometimes you just want plain old white rice and they definitely didn't use jasmine rice. Otherwise it was not cooked well because it was dry.

Overall our lunch kind of was lame. Service was slow as our server was pretty slammed so we were barely checked on. We also got our check super late BUT they were able to split it three ways and there wasn't a card minimum which is nice. I wouldn't recommend this place",2,1,9

When I walked in to carry out, the restaurant was full with a huge bachelorette party. Two women were belting out Lady Gaga over the karaoke machine, with the rest of the party singing along.  Be warned.

Ordered Tom Kha and Chicken larb. The larb was okay.  As for the former, the reviews below are right: something is up with the Tom Kha soup. There's an odd nuttiness--almost like peanut butter--in the soup that clashes with both the coconut and any heat in the soup.  More positively, the tofu in the soup was fine, and there were a good amount of mushrooms.

The food was fine. The Thai tea is only $2 but was extremely sweet (like 2x a normal Thai tea). The pork pad see ew was decent, but not particularly flavorful or salty and saucy enough.

One last comment, my guy and I decided to start a new Christmas tradition this year since I wasn't feeling well enough to cook a fancy dinner on Christmas eve.  I always thought it would be fun to go for Chinese,  a la The Christmas Story.  This buffet was the first place that popped into my head.  Thankfully they were open, although we arrived about 30 mins before they were set to close so we were prepared to have to stuff our faces pretty quickly.  So not the case!  There were quite a few tables of people still.  They were still bringing out fresh food (even up to the time we left, which was after closing time), the staff was still very attentive and never made us feel rushed.

Any establishment that clumps a multitude of ethnic groups and benignly calls it ""Asian"" usually sends me running in the opposite direction. But like usual places I've no interest for, I go because I'm dragged by my friends. We're broke students with loans up the wazoo. So it's no wonder we choose cheap food that can not only fill us up but also potentially kill us. But I didn't get food poisoning here, huzzah! Friday dinner came out to be about $16+tip per person.

There is a large selection of ""Asian foods."" There's a Mongolian grill (where you choose what you want and it gets freshly stir fried). I didn't try it, but the noodles looked overly squishy and very saucy. I also noticed that my friends who got it didn't finish it. There's an area for sushi and rolls- the fish didn't look or taste fresh, but really what can you expect out of the price you're paying. Beyond the sushi and rolls is an area of vegetables and then lots and lots of seafood selections. To name a few, there were lobsters, fried crab, crab legs, fried shrimp, steamed fish, seafood soups, fried squid, shrimp, clams etc. There were also non seafood items such as western favorites - orange chicken, broccoli beef, fried wontons, egg rolls, etc. Lastly, there's a dessert bar that consists of cookies, puddings, frozen yogurt, and fruit. 

The service was annoying. The waitress pretended to be bashful and nice by saying that she didn't want to bother us later so we should pay immediately... before most of us had even finished a plate of food. We were literally in the middle of eating, mouths grotesquely stuffed, hands greasy ... and she came to pester us to pay. We were a huge group, so I can kind of understand? Although paying in the beginning before we began to eat would've been more opportune. And at least be upfront, instead of faking the bashfulness and saying that you don't want to bother us later, when you're clearly bothering us now. At one point, they lost the receipt for one of our guys, and the waiters were yelling at each other in Chinese in front of us. The rest of us awkwardly just ate while the waiters yelled over our heads. So 2 stars for service.

Upon entering this place not much of the staff spoke english, but they know how to count your money perfectly. There isn't much to write about the decor it's more like junior high cafeteria style wooden tables and small hard uncomfortable wooden chairs. There's a mediocre sushi bar near the front entrance.

The asian style ribs were so over cooked we couldn't eat them. We asked the waitress not to bring our drinks until we had gotten our food. I think the walls pay more attention to what you say then these people. Upon our return to the table there sat our drinks. Of course I requested she make all fresh drinks and watched her pour fresh drinks as well. I am very skeptical about unattended drinks and foods myself. Of course she wasn't very happy with my request and watching her back either. If you love seafood as I do such as fresh unlimited king crabs legs, fried blue claw crabs and fish etc. Now as of 2013 to present. Go to the Buffet @ Asia on Flamingo and Eastern Ave, Las Vegas. My nail technician recommended that place and we love it. 

The service is very friendly and the foods are always fresh and hot. There's a very high turn over during dinner hours from 4 pm to 9 pm. The lunch doesn't offer the same menu as the dinner does no king crab legs, fried frog legs, fried crab or pepper shrimp. The price for dinner is $13.95 you leave a tip after you dine. Alcohol drinks are extra but there's unlimited teas and water and Chi tea too. The dessert doesn't offer real ice cream it's just a frozen like iced milk. But they do have a selection of asian desserts cakes and cookies etc. The ribs are tasty but over cooked and dry. The veggies and rice are very good. King crab legs are a good size and plenty of them. But you must watch when they put them out because people grab them two plates full at a time. The atomosphere is relaxed and family friendly. They also have a huge wok station where you can choose your own ingredients too.

The food here was simply OK. The sushi was anything-but-fresh bordering on questionable. Their chopped up lobster chunks were plentiful and decent. The hot shrimp was probably my favorite thing. The spicy chicken was actually spicy. The beef was terrible as expected at a seafood place. The soft serve dessert was too icy.

Perhaps the dealer had gotten a 21 one time too many and now you're completely broke but still want to eat your sadness away? Well look no further than Buffet @ Asia. Who can drop that much money Bacchanal Buffet anyways? For as little as $15 (that said I didn't get too good of a look at the prices if you know what I mean), you can gorge yourself alongside others determined to commit gluttony. Score yourself a 15% coupon and you even get to save some more! Maybe that $30 that you saved can lead to a jackpot! Just be aware, this is a Chinese buffet, as in don't expect the best.

Like most Chinese buffets at dinner time, the place was loaded with seafood. Most importantly, they had dim sum style lobster! For $15, you're getting all you can eat lobster. Am I dreaming and living the buffet life or what? Throw in salmon sashimi, crab legs, frog legs, and dynamite and it's a home run! Unfortunately, I must admit that the food is obviously not of the best quality. The clams were sandy and had a weird, somewhat metallic taste. The oysters weren't very fresh and weren't cleaned properly. The nigiri had obviously been sitting out for a long time and should have been disposed of. At the beginning of service, the salmon sashimi was very very good. Then, it became horrible cuts and believe it or not, I found a piece of bone in a piece. Yuck! The shrimp dynamite was deliciously cheesy and creamy but none of the shrimp were deveined. I don't know about anything else I found that the taste of the food in general was strong; it's heavily seasoned. 

Now, onto service. Holy moly! My table literally never had an empty plate at any time. There were times they carted my plate away while I still had food on it that I was getting to! And yes, most of the time, the item about to be taken away were lobsters and crab legs. My water was constantly being filled to the very blink. They were probably hoping that I'd get full off the water. 

Overall, for $15, this place is a steal. It's a bit messy but this is a Chinese buffet boy! You do't come here for world class service; you come here for food at dirt cheap prices.",3,1,8

Now, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression when I describe the Golden Flower.  It's not the best or most authentic Chinese food you will ever eat.  You will not find an overly-friendly wait staff.  What you will find is a business that caters to the local lunch crowd, and they are damn good at it!

Lunch specials range in price from $6-$9. Specials include choice of soup, choice of rice, an egg roll and a cream-cheese rangoon.  Definitely try the pork fried rice. You will be pleased. I also recommend trying any shrimp dish.  The shrimp is always plump and flavorful. 

The staff does a good job of getting you in and out fast. Sometimes the entree will arrive before you finish your soup. But the staff is not trying to get rid of you. They just serve the food immediately as it leaves the kitchen, which is great if you need to get back to work, but give it a minute to cool before digging in.

Just to let you know, the Golden Flower has survived in the same location for 20 years while every other surrounding business has at one time or another had to close it's doors.  That's a testament to how good they are at what they do, and they have done it consistently for a very long time.

In a town with a tradition of imploding old casinos to make way for new ones, it's always nice to visit a local haunt that hasn't changed over the span of a generation. Don't ever change, Golden Flower. Don't you ever change.

FYI - There is a surcharge when paying with a bank card for totals under $10. Also, ask for the check when you're ready. They won't always bring it automatically.",4,0,5

We were not disappointed and found out first hand what all of the rave reviews were about!

We started with a hot pot of Oolong tea which is a nice option and treat when dining out for Chinese and that is not always an option elsewhere.

We ordered an appetizer of fried shrimp and it was yummy, the shrimp and the fried coating was delicious.

We also decided on an order of sweet and sour shrimp which was very good as well! It was more of the same yummy fried shrimps mixed with carrots, onions, and bell pepper in a delicious sweet and sour sauce which comes with white rice.

We also ordered almond chicken which was full of white meat chicken, generous fresh slithered almonds in an Amazing light brown sauce that had a hint of sweetness.

This is a true Cantonese style Chinese restaurant which has always been my favorite.

Golden Flower reminds me of the exceptional Cantonese restaurants we would eat at back in the 80's in the Pacific NW.

2nd warning sign; upon entering the place it was packed by obese Caucasians (except for two slender men) and very few Asians.
3rd warning sign; when I asked for chopsticks the waitress laughed and walked off.   I use chopsticks at home as I find it paces my eating and allows me to be more in touch with my food.   With a fork it is far too easy to just shovel it in.

The reason for 1 star is there is no option for zero.   The two waitresses acted as if they were not wanting to be working and barely interacted with the customers.   I realize that in some Chinese restaurants service can be slow or haphazard but this place takes it to a new low level. 

The food quality is good but flavorless.  I had the chicken bok choy lunch special.   It comes with soup, an eggroll and 3 cups of white rice.  Oh and also the flatest understuffed crab rangoon in the world.  While the chicken and bok choy tasted fresh it was swimming is a glossy brown sauce that tasted like watered down soy sauce with a little corn starch thrown in.  I avoided the rice, egg roll and very flat crab rangoon as they did not look appealing. 

While I picked through my lunch I witnessed one customer walk out because it was 30 mins and they had no food.  Mine took 15 minutes.  Instead of calling this a Chinese restaurant it should be labeled as an American restaurant with a Chinese influence.   I think the only reason this place manages to stay in business is because their Caucasian clientele doesn't know what good and authentic Chinese food tastes or  looks like.

I have 6 g-kids and they love going here.  the portions are NOT small by any means and we never have to ask for a refill on anything.

The Beef with green beans was good.  No weird fat bits and the flavor was good.  Not spicy.

The Kung Pow chicken was flavorful, but should have been spicy as it had the pepper icon by it.  So, not the best.

The Chicken Chow Mein was awful.  There was nothing wrong with the chicken.  It was weird looking, but tasted good and no weird texture.  I think they must pound it first so it looks different than usual.  The noodles were the average type used, but the sauce they used on it just tasted awful.  I have had Chow Mein in no less than 30 places in my life and they usually taste pretty similar and are a almost sweet soy flavor.  This was just bad.  Won't order it again.  There is a place in the shopping center at Serene & Eastern near a German Bakery that is much better all around.

The waitress was very friendly and the portions are generous, it doesn't make up for the fact that the broccoli in my food was way overcooked and the rice was still crunchy.  

But my main complaint about this restaurant is that it is DIRTY!  I moved the salt shaker to make more room on the table and I could feel the layers of dust and grease on it.  The bathroom was beyond description.

162073,r78SFCUvvIH3dvSeji8Qyg,OWQJrnXbWkLTI1-qRkkUpQ,"""After being on a cross country flight from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas to meet up with my brother and a week on vacationing on the Strip, I was anxious to see a real locals restaurant. My brother drove me to a nice Chinese restaurant in a happening Von's shopping center called Golden Flower. "" In reality if Yelp was in existence ten years ago in the summer of 2014 this is how I would of started the review. Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant holds a place in my heart because it is one of if not the first locals Chinese restaurant that I visited in Las Vegas when I was living in Fort Lauderdale ten years ago. For at least ten years Golden Flower has been blooming in the very injured shopping center at the corner of Pecos and Russell Roads. Where this shopping centers Von's, Denny's, New York Bagel shop, Starbuck's, and so on rest in peace, the spirit of Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant is alive. 

  It was yesterday before I attended the Alcohol Awareness Training class that I wanted to take advantage of a nearby Chinese Restaurant luncheon special. After a near decade hiatus, I was returning to Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant. 

  Golden Flower is still the same cozy Chinese restaurant as I remember back when the Outcasts ""Hey ya"" was topping the charts. It brings back further memories of the cozy Chinese restaurants in Long Island, New York. The oldies from the 1980s and 1990s added to the relaxing environment. Listening to the acoustic version of ""Hotel California"" made each bite of the shrimp chow mein that much more enjoyable. 

  More than the cozy environment and music, the service left me with a better taste of the Golden Flower. From the time I stepped inside to when I paid, Christie was very welcoming. She invited me to sit at any table in the relatively small dining room that was sparsely populated by diners. She was on top of refills and would always say, ""Thank you."" Ultimately she never rushed me. I'd overhear a couple of customers thank Christie for the great service. 

  The luncheon specials are a good deal. They are in affect Monday to Saturday from 11 am to 3 pm. In similar style to the luncheon specials throughout the Las Vegas Valley the price is between $5.95 and $6.95. the reality is that when you add a glass of Coke, tip, and tax it comes out to the figure of $11. But the Coke could be unnecessary because I vividly recall the delicious hot tea here. Let me talk more about the lunch specials. They include either egg drop or hot and sour soup. But, if you love wonton soup like I do, it is $2.25 per person. There is more. The lunch special also includes an egg roll, crunchy noodles with duck sauce and spicy mustard and either BBQ pork fried rice or steamed rice. The lunch special features an entree. The choices include numerous styles of chow mein, pepper steak, curry chicken, and sweet and sour chicken (I posted a picture of the menu in this business listing). 

   I ordered the shrimp chow mein luncheon special. The crunchy noodles were decent. I am a fan of the wide noodles and not the skinny ones they serve here. Regardless they went good with the spicy mustard. Before I could get more acquainted with the noodles, Christie placed the hot and sour soup on the white tablecloth. The soup tasted hot and sour. The next visit I intend to pay the $2.25 for the wonton soup. The egg roll which reminded me of a spring roll was Panda Express allright. Now the portion of the shrimp chow mein with fried rice was enormous. The quality was magnificent. In a couple of my previous reviews on Las Vegas Chinese Restaurants I voice my opinion that the chow mein noodles are filler food. Golden Flower serves flavorful chow mein that hint of lo mein sprinkled with generous amounts of chunky juicy appetizing shrimp and sprinklers of onions. This is an example of both quantity and quality. The Best of Las Vegas has bestowed Golden Flower with The Best of Vegas awards in 2002, 2008, and 2012.

  In hindsight, I am cognizant of the fact that somethings stay the same. In the period of a decade Golden Flower is still the same local Chinese Restaurant serving remarkable Chinese food luncheon specials in a cozy environment. In the period of a decade I remain a fan of Golden Flower.",4,0,10

I tried the general so chicken on this last visit and boy I was in a sea of bliss with this delicious dish!

I have been craving it since, I dream of it, I need it, I want it more and more.


I have 12 check ins at Golden Flower and every single dish I try is just as Amazing. The staff is Fantastic, the food is top quality and the prices are low for the giant portions.

Their war wonton soup is a delicious meal in itself as well for those cold nights! It is full to the brim with shrimp, bbq pork, chicken, veggies and wontons! A must try!",5,1,10

Good size shrimp and the walnut sauce is what I expected.  Salt and pepper pork chops is my favorite.   It reminds me of this family chinese place we used to go in Long Beach,  CA.  Fish with black bean sauce was good also.  I wasn't too crazy about the appetizer,  BBQ ribs,  it was a lil tough.   Defintely going back to this place.  No need to drive to Spring Mountain. ..close to our home in Henderson.",5,1,9
162156,62MtD3ssYiIczSlkUiUyTw,ZZtEx_UutNxz9B5knTL4tQ,"I don't know if they had an off day or something, but the food was just horrible. I ordered the pad Thai noodles, chicken chow mien and egg rolls.  The best thing we got was the chicken chow mien, but don't get too excited it was the best of the worst.  They do give large portions of food, but I like quality over quantity. The pad Thai sauce tasted like it came from a box. Most of my order went into the trash :( the egg rolls hardly had any meat in it.  We asked for hot mustard as a condiment and we got some weird concoction of curried spice with French's yellow mustard.  Needless to say it was disgusting. 

I was super sad when they said they don't make walnut shrimp, but hey it happens!  They have cashew shrimp, but after reading the ingredients I knew it was far from what I wanted. 

Maybe it was a bad day for the chef?! Regardless I doubt I will be coming back.  I was super excited about trying this place too because of the ratings and reviews.  I am severely disappointed.  Perhaps it's because they try to cater to two different types of cuisines.  Maybe they should concentrate on being a Chinese restaurant and drop the Thai stuff.",1,1,9
162157,hLCDw4HQFebsvPp01TgTkQ,ZZtEx_UutNxz9B5knTL4tQ,"I've never written a review on Yelp. Not ever. But after our experience in the Las Vegas desert, I feel obligated as a man of decency to contribute and help those who would befall the same fate as we did. The debate began with a growing urgency for sustenance, as we were reeling from a heavy day of soaking our livers in beer, tequila, Fireball, and some ungodly concoctions called ""Buzz Balls"". Mr. Chop Chop arose as a solution because apparently, crab rangoon was not available on other delivery menus as far as we could tell. Why we were even considering ordering seafood for delivery in any form while in the middle of a goddamn desert is beyond my comprehension, but the group was insistent. We placed a large order to feed six and were told that delivery would be a one hour affair. With time to kill, there were a few beers left and the film ""Tower Heist"" was airing on television. If you've ever seen ""Tower Heist"", capped by brilliant penmanship and epic performances from Ben Stiller and Casey Affleck, then you know that such a cinematic gem can only build your appetite for the finest Asian cuisine, because you are literally starving for quality after watching such schlock. Enter Mr. Chop Chop, not one, but two hours later.

The crab rangoons looked like they were previously used as suppositories in a subsidized retirement community. Usually having no crabs in Vegas is a good thing, unless you're expecting it in your food as opposed to your nether region. I could not surmise a more pathetic excuse for this staple of Ameri-Asian cuisine than what revealed itself in those styrofoam containers. Suffice to say, they are rotting in a dumpster somewhere in the bowels of the Wynn property.

The chicken chow mein noodles tasted as if God decided that sodium no longer had a place on the table of periodic elements. Consider the effect on our ecosystem if this were the case. All sea life would perish, average blood pressure would drop, and Mr. Chop Chop's cooking would still be available to damn civilization. I made it through about five bites before wisely placing the carton in the $25 incidental refrigerator we had delivered to the room. Some poor sap was going to get drunk later and eat that. But I knew it wouldn't be me. 

In the aftermath of eating, everyone in the group was writhing in pain. There was no satisfaction on the miserable faces of my companions. People would disappear randomly in 20 minute intervals and I can only imagine that this was time spent slumped over the toilet in a desperate attempt to void our bodies of the filth that was Mr. Chop Chop's plague. Ipecac syrup would have tasted like holy ambrosia at that point. 

To those that wrote positive reviews, I have two theories. One is that you have personal ties to the restaurant, which is totally fine. People come onto Yelp all the time to defend their establishments, however fruitless and absurd it may be. The second theory is that you've never left the desert, nor eaten any other Asian cuisine in your life. I'm not here to knock you down or criticize your taste. Many find comfort in bland, diarrhea-inducing food to ""flush"" themselves, and I respect that. This beef is between me and Mr. Chop Chop. And should this beef ever resolve itself, it certainly won't be in any dish served by this restaurant in the lonesome outskirts of the Las Vegas strip.",1,1,5

Excuse me, but do you work there? If so I am sorry if I offended you or your wife on her cooking, although last time I checked Yelp is an open forum for people to share individual opinions on dining experience with others.  Maybe you should use this post as constructive criticism rather than resort to childish rants on women's 'monthly cycles' as though that would be a reason for me to write a post where I continuously say it may have been an 'off day' for the chef.

I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!

Walking in we were greeted and taken to our seats. Water and menus were brought right to our table right away. We shared ""family style"" and picked out somethings we all like. Food is brought out on a cart and served to you. 

Fried Wontons ($5.95) - These came 12 per order and I liked them. Light, yet crunchy with a small bit of chicken in the center. It came with a sweet and sour and spicy mustard dipping sauces. 

Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.

Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.

Szechuan Beef ($16.95) - So good! The beef was so tender and the whole dish together just tasted great. The huge fresh mushrooms were tasty.

Orange slices were brought to each of us at the end of the meal. I felt the charge of $3.95 for a soda was steep. Free refills, but almost the price of an appetizer. The service was great and we left full and pleased! The owner stopped to talk to us for a moment and she's genuinely passionate about the type of food they are putting out as well the type of service they provide.

They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside.

She even prepared the salad we ordered fresh in front of us. The food isn't greasy in anyway which id w hat I find at most places I have been too. The portion of food you get for the price is very good. I would suggest because if the portion sizes that you either plan on sharing with your table or taking leftovers home.

The Mai Tai was so good. Didn't realize how much alcohol they put it in until it crept up on me later. 

Food was fresh and really tasty. 

Shrimp Won Tons- most places serve these with imitation crab and you normally can't find a place to serve good quality won tons anymore. These were crunchy and delicious. Not greasy like in most places.

Chicken Salad with peanuts - this was good but out of the whole meal would be last on my list to reorder. Peanuts were all I could taste. 

Chicken Lettuce wraps- not overpowered by the sauce and crunchy but again would probably put this item second to last. 

The Strawberry chicken brought back good memories. Just as I remember from childhood. It was still crisp outside with it even smothered in strawberry sauce. My fork going through didn't make it turn to mush so good job balancing the crisp outside while you still have plenty of sauce. 

All time favorite is Am Lee Beef!!! Can't describe in words how good.

  Money talks. When I  spend money I talk about it on Yelp. In the next few paragraphs I will talk about my lunch in Amlee Chinese Cuisine. 

 In recent times I have been trying out the different Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. After visiting Amy's Hallmark, I decided to try Amlee Chinese Cuisine near my house. 

 Amlee Chinese Cuisine is located in a small strip mall at the southeast corner of Sunset and Sandhill Roads. From what I read, Amlee Chinese Cuisine has been standing in this exact spot for thirty years. It has been thirty years of family ownership. When a restaurant is in business for thirty years, they rise above it all. In 2003, Amlee Chinese Cuisine rised above it all when the Best of Las Vegas voted it the best Chinese Restaurant in 2003 (www.usmenuguide.com/amleegourmet.htm).

   When I walked inside Amlee Chinese Cuisine at lunchtime, I saw a bar to my right and a spacious dining room to the left. The tables were large and nearly empty at this visit. 

  The personable waitress led me to a table in this comfortable dining room. Soon, she poured the water into a clean glass. Nonetheless I ordered a Coke with my lunch. This is the first Chinese Restaurant that has ever served me Coke from Mexico. So, it was a cosmopolitan lunch with Mexican Coke and Chinese food. 

  The luncheon special attracted me to Amlee Chinese Cuisine. As my fellow Yelpers have stated, the prices here are higher. I can't support the argument that you get what you pay for when I had food of equivalent taste and quality for the same price recently at dinner in China Bistro, NY Chinese Restaurant, and China Tango Bistro. The lunch specials range between $7.95 and $10.95. They include an entre, soup of the day that is expectedly the omnipresent egg drop soup, egg roll, and choice of fried or white rice. For $1.50 extra, they will substitute the soup of the day with wonton soup. With a Coke from Mexico, wonton soup, and tip my lunch special added up to around $17.50.

  I ordered the shrimp chow mein. The personable waitress stated that this is one of her favorites. In my opinion, the wonton soup was my favorite. I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life and not get tired of it. Maybe that's because wonton soup is in my Top 25 Favorite Foods List. The fried rice was a lighter color than I was used to. However, it was delicious. The noodle based shrimp chow mein was also delicious. I appreciated all the vegetables that tasted like onion and cabage mixed in. On the other hand I would of appreciated more than four shrimp. Come to think of it, I would of appreciated it if the meal included crunchy noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard. 

  I have done enough talking about Amlee Chinese Cuisine. In my opinion that is based on experiences dining in Chinese Restaurants, Amlee is a good Chinese Restaurant that I anticipate serving the Las Vegas community in the decades ahead.",3,0,9

We had a table of eight and everyone skipped the high priced beverages, yet our bill still came to $43 per person. I have had better Chinese food at a buffet, the only difference being the buffet has a better selection and you can go there five or six times for the same price. I am very budget conscience and went to enjoy a meal with family, instead felt as though I had been robbed.",1,1,10
162359,xovQxIW4o_TpdQksDArbig,w9KBaltlg7B_tca-nNfj_A,"I'll be honest, after reading the reviews for this place, I really, really wanted to love them. The restaurant itself is very clean, inviting, and the staff really sweet. The menu had everything I was looking for on it. I was making a quick stop for lunch before meeting up with someone, figured I had plenty of time.

I placed my order, got some water with lemon in it, and then glanced at my phone - woops - I had miscalculated and was going to be late, especially if I took my time eating! It was totally not their fault, they were on it with the service, it was all on me.

Glad that I hadn't ordered anything more exciting than water, I grabbed my purse and went up to the front counter. I apologized and asked if I could change my order to to-go. She was cool about it. A few minutes later, I had my bagged up lunch and was out the door. I made my appointment in time, and, luckily, it was casual enough that they didn't mind if I whipped out my chopsticks and started munching away.

I had ordered the orange peel chicken. It sounded really good on paper. It tasted like...salt. Honestly, I found nothing really good about it. Nothing really bad, either, just kind of meh, like grocery store Chinese. I had ordered it spicy, and it wasn't. It was just so-so.

Just for the record, when I order ""spicy"" - babes, that means melt my face, curl my hair, steam out my ears spicy. Not just extra salt. Perhaps there was a communication problem?

I gave them three stars (rounded up from 2-1/2, which isn't an option) for service and because I'm willing to come back with the hubby to try other things. Based on the other reviews, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try again. They've been here a long time and I haven't. Maybe we were both having an off day?",3,1,3

Personal recommendations:
- Salt and pepper pork! - not too salty, full of flavor and pretty hefty amount of food for ~$7
- Roasted Duck - I love duck, and I seriously think this duck is close to the best in the planet. It's so moist, not overly drenched in soy sauce, and the skin has an awesome way of staying crispy! It's bomb with white rice
- Schezuan Chicken Salad - standard lettuce salad with wonton crisps and tons of chicken. For dressing, it's a mix of chili peppers and soy sauce, and....while this dish isn't so complicated, and I have doubt that this is actually served in Schezuan, China... It's still really tasty and I do have the occasional cravingzz for it 

On another note, I've slowly been moving towards the vegetarian sides of things, and while this restaurant has some really awesome non-v options, there are only a few solely vegetarian options. Their Schezuan Bean Curd is good but not so special. It's basically just soft tofu in a thick, savory sauce. Last, still no brown rice up in heaaa! #saynotodiabetes",4,1,6

It was my first visit and I am impressed.  The place does not stand out physically by any means.  Not from the outside anyhow.  When you first walk in it does not seem any better.  The front counter looks like any Chinese take-out place.  Nothing special about it.  But I was quickly greeted and seated in a very friendly manner.  Service with a smile is a truism here.  The dining area is very clean and not in the least bit gimicky like some other Chinese places around town.  This is classy without being gaudy.  The blue floral print on the benches and seats if soothing and comfortable.  It also brightens up the room a bit.

I began looking immediately to the noodle section of the menu.  I wanted chow fun noodles, my new favorite.  Before I found the dry style beef chow fun and decided on that, I was brought a pot of hot tea, a glass of ice water and a bowl of crispy fried noodles with sweet and sour.  It was like they read my mind.  Soon, the waitress came back to take my order.  She asked me if I ever had the dish before and told me a bit about it.  ""Fun with bean sprouts and beef"" and ""True Hong Kong style"" were how the dish was described to me.  I was also assured this was her favorite dish.  Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.  I sure liked it though.  The noodles were not as dried out and chewy as at some other places I have ordered chow fun from.  They were still tender but with that trademark chew of a rice noodle without being like rubber.  The beef was tender and delicious.  Maybe a bit sparse but honestly, with the bean sprouts and green onions mixed in with the noodles, the amount of beef was hardly disappointing.  I still came away full and floating away after a pot of tea and three glasses of water on top of my meal.

The restaurant looks like an older run down place serving up Americanized Chinese food. The whole time I was sitting inside and reading the menu I felt unsure if I really wanted to eat here but I told myself I should at least try it since I was there. I ordered a beef chow fun to go since it's kind of hard to mess that dish up so I figured I was safe.
 
When my order was ready it was handed to be in a bag where I noticed they didn't provide utensils or chopsticks but I was too lazy to go back in since I was already in the car. Strike 1. When I opened the box I noticed that the portions were way smaller than most other Chinese places while they are charging a full entree price ($8.50-10.00)  for everything including the beef chow fun. Strike 2. The beef was fully cooked but had a weird taste to it and the dish overall just seemed bland. Strike 3. 

I would not recommend this place at all and even Panda Express would be a better choice since their food has more flavor. This place also has a $20 card minimum so bring cash if you're not going to be spending over 20 bucks, which I'm sure is not hard to do here.",2,1,4

I like that I can grab something to eat while getting a few items at the store. It just is convenient without having to then make another stop for food. I have to say the employees here are awesome. Well, the manager this last time was having lunch and talking with someone (maybe having a meeting?) while this girl was hustling to take care of the orders. I questioned how long something has been sitting out and she offered to make it fresh if I didn't mind waiting. Of course not! I can't believe how this girl was working so hard to take care of the customers and offering to make me fresh food while the manager laughed away in her conversation only a couple feet from me. She should have excused herself and pitched in for a moment. I took the time to tell the girl helping me that she was a hard worker and that I appreciated her service. I only wish I caught her name to give her a shout-out in this review. 

I like to get the 2 or 3 item combo. I always choose fried rice because I find their chow mein to have too many veggies vs. noodles and the noodles are kind of dry. The Firecracker Chicken had good flavor. It isn't very spicy but has a nice baby kick. I tried Beijing Beef and it was sweet and spicy and my favorite of all I ate.

But for those like me who visit Las Vegas from time to time, this is a hidden gem in the heart of Las Vegas. The one thing, they might need to work on is a bigger bathroom and maybe a little re-model inside. But, the food is mamma-mia good! Another few things that might need to be worked on is dessert options, and maybe have Thai Ice Tea or Milk Ice Tea? That would give options for us who just want to drink something other than tea? Yet, this restaurant hasn't steered us wrong yet. I think the favorite dish of mine is the frog legs. My dad loves the beef with bitter melon. All this restaurant needs is to re-vamp itself with some renovations or remodeling. Otherwise, food is great. I would definitely order the frog legs, sweet and sour pork, and steamed rice.

Of course, I left all the ordering to Lily and her mom and they picked their favorites. We had Steamed Fish, Tofu with Bamboo Fungus and Chinese Broccoli, Salt and Pepper Squid, and Steamed Fish in Black Bean Sauce. Everything was really delicious!

I'm not sure what type of fish was used in our dishes (the menus are not very descriptive in English and there was a lot of Mandarin flying around), but it may have been catfish and sole according to Lily's mom. They were both tasty and picked up the sauces really well. The S&P squid was not my favorite rendition of this favorite dish, but still tasty. Now, the tofu dish really surprised me. I normally dislike fried tofu because it's dry and just gross, however, this tofu was perfectly fried with an insanely creamy texture inside! That paired with the sauce, Chinese broccoli, and bamboo fungus, major YUM! **Side note: the menu says bamboo, but that's deceiving. It's actually a type of mushroom called Bamboo Fungus. Rich in protein, dietary fiber, and carbohydrates; also used in Chinese medicine (thank you Wikipedia). Very interesting specimen!**

During lunch, prices are very, very reasonable. A bargain. Also, if you dine with 4+ people for dinner, you're given a complimentary roasted chicken! If that isn't incentive enough to dine here!

It was about 2pm when I got here and they were still busy so I took it as a good sign.

However, it didn't quite live up to what I expected.. I didn't have that high of expectations to begin with since I know we are in Vegas and it's not like they are known for Chinese food...but I didn't expect that poor of quality either.

To begin with - the service was okay - I mean I didn't expect much from an Asian place - and they only had like two waitress/waiter and it was busy - so you can imagine that they would forget to bring you things you asked for until you asked about 7-8 times. 

The food was ehhh - I was kind of disappointed because on their online menu they offered Deer meat but they didn't have that on their menu when we got there - only the ordinary stuff - I really did wanted to try Deer meat with mushroom and sacha sauce but they didn't have any dish that offered deer meat so not sure what that's about.

So instead we order three dishes: Salt and pepper fried shrimp, clay pot chicken and pork crispy chow mein noodles. 

The salt and pepper fried shrimp was small and over-fried. The clay pot chicken - didn't have a lot of chicken and the chicken was chopped up in very little pieces it was difficult to eat - there was more mushrooms than chicken. The only dish I thought was fairly decent was the pork crispy chow mein noodles - but then again it wasn't very crispy - they slathered the sauce all over it so it became soggy instead but at least the flavor was okay.

Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.",2,0,4

I had tried a number of restaurants in the Vegas Chinatown area and wasn't really impressed, but KJ Kitchen was an exception, and by far the best Chinese food I've had in the area. 

There's a bit of a wait usually if you come for dinner, but the food is worth it. I've come here a couple of times with big parties and we're always left satisfied. Mainly Chinese customers, and the portions are big and prices reasonable. One of the best things on the menu is the roasted duck. The skin is always crispy and the meat isn't dry at all. In fact, my local friend comes here almost every week and orders the duck. The salt and pepper pork chops, mu shu pork, sitr fried noodles, sichuan style green beans, and a lot of the seafood dishes are always money. I haven't tried everything on the menu but it seems like it's hard to go wrong with anything here.

KJ Kitchen isn't the best food I've ever had, and I'm not a local, but it's the best Chinese food I've had in Vegas!",4,1,6

Braised Pork Belly w/ Pickled Vegetable - very good.  Not too fatty or salty.  Good amount of pork meat to fat.  (although i love more fat, but i know it's bad for me)
Oysters w/ Green Scallions in Sizzling Pot - Good.  A big greasy tho.  But very tasty.  Never had a dish like this before, so I liked it.
Mixed Seafood w/ Vegetables - Good amount of seafood.  Good!
Sauteed Green Beans w/ Minced Pork - Good also.  First dish to be eaten up completely clean.
Roast Duck - Not bad.  For a restaurant that doesn't have ducks hanging in the window, it was decent.  A bit fatty, but still good flavor and not too salty.
Fish Stomach Soup - Good also.  We started out with this.  Good amount of fish.
Sweet n Sour Pork Chops - I love this dish, I always get it everywhere I go.  It's such an ABC americanized dish, but it brings back my childhood memories.  This place made it good.  Not too bready, not too fatty.  Not too sweet. 
Desert was FREE! - Green bean w/ tapioca.  Good.  Thank you!",4,0,10

Honey walnut shrimp - it was crispy and smothered in mayo sauce making it ultra creamy. Yet, I think it was missing something. It felt very one noted in the flavor department and I felt overall that it needed more seasoning to bring it all together. It's certainly not the best honey walnut shrimp I've ever had, but it passes as good. 4/5

Vegetable egg-rolls - don't try ordering these! I ate one and it tasted like dish water. The filling was extremely sad and there was nothing stuffed inside the rolls except for cabbage and maybe carrots? Whatever it was, it disintegrated from the deep frying, making it barely noticeable and mush. Also the sweet and sour sauce to dip was watery and tasted off. Very disappointing and not worth getting. 1/5

The hot and sour soup was excellent! It was the favorite thing we ordered. It came out piping hot and the presentation was lovely - Nice color, texture, and most importantly flavor. It was one of the better hot and sour soups I've had. Comforting and addicting 5/5",4,1,10

Fried Fish:  This is the item to get.  A large whole fish for about $7.  Comes with a ginger and soy sauce.  I think the regular price is something like $24....Crispy and flavorful.

Salt & Pepper Shrimp:   Pretty traditional Chinese dish.  Good flavor, the shrimp were rather small but then again, it was a lunch special.

Sweet & Sour Pork Chop:  This dish fell flat.  Mostly bones or fat.  Too much breading and too greasy.  Avoid this item.

String Beans:  Good dish but was a little more oily than I have seen in the past.",3,0,3

When we finally flagged someone down to take our order (I'm guessing the owner), the first thing he said to us was ""HURRY UP!  HURRY UP!"" before we even ordered. 

Our first dish came with a LONG HAIR chilling on the side of the plate. It was so noticeable that I saw the hair when they were bringing our dish over.  That is just RUDE that they were too lazy to wipe it off. The server watched me pick out the hair and didnt say anything. I was contemplating about taking a picture of the hair but I was afraid they would spit in my food. Nice first impression.

Not sure if I would run back considering there are so many other options in this area, but I think it was okay...in a pinch.  
In an effort not to sound completely inappropriate I'll say this. I usually go toe ""ethnic"" places where the people of that particular ethnicity frequent.

Service: There is none.   All the servers aren't kind at all anymore and I don't feel like a guest.  They treat people like second class citizens instead of welcoming them into their restaurant and ensuring quality experience.

Food: Took forever and wasn't able to try it since it never came out.

When you find a gem like KJ Kitchen, you will get fresh, authentic, delicious food at a great price!  
I can't help but laugh at all the reviews saying the service sucks.. If you only have one date night and want to be served with class, you shouldn't be eating Chinese food... Or go down to harbor palace, same quality of food, decent service, double the price!  KJ Kitchen is the best Chinese good in town, hands down!

Salted fish and chicken fried rice

Looked like a $14 TV dinner and had chicken in place of most of the seafood. Strangely the menu didn't mention chicken. I had to ask for the included dessert. I guess I didn't spend enough for my $14 fried rice! I will not be back and you would be wise to try some of the great Chinese restaurants in the area.,1,0,5

Service is not the most attentive but genuine and polite, food is fresh and great.

Menu is extensive and a bit more expensive than you might expect- but the quality is the reason why, hence my use of the word authentic. Also, portions are enormous. Many seafood dishes including sea cucumber, lobster, and crab. Some dim sum-like items on the appetizer menu, including my favorite fried shrimp balls, but here they go for larger portions with a justifiably higher price tag (order of 8 for $13).

Getting a few dishes to share family-style is the way to go here: Szechuan scallops are stir fried with onions, bell pepper, and bamboo, and is a great dish here. Another favorite is the barbeque duck, which is available at a well-priced $9 for the half order and is served with an amazing sauce.",3,0,8

I hate wasting money, and to me this was a waste of money.  Saturday, dinner time, it was packed in there, there was a 15min wait to be seated. It was just me and my 3yr old nephew, yet they called out and seated numbers that were after us. (They lose an entire STAR for that tacky sh!t right, a potential 4STAR rating is still achievable right? NO, HELLS NAH)

We were finally seated, I promise it looked like a feeding frenzy in there.  I'm a sushi fan, it just looked very contaminated, people breathing over it, no please make my Sushi in front of me Thank You much.

Empty tins w/ no food, granted it was busy in there and maybe they could not keep up with the demand but when they did food did come out it was enough for like 5 people.  Some dished were piping hot and others were luke warm.  I'll just comment on the items I DID eat:

Orange Chicken: ok, I didn't eat this but I had to comment on this, Orange Chicken is my go to  item when I go to these type of buffet. Um, Orange Chicken is not suppose to be SOUPY.  I cannot make this up, it looked like orange chicken soup, NO BUENO.

Chow Mien: hmm, greasy, no crunch to the veggies

Baked Mussel: it was ok, mussels were minced with some kind of cream cheese and melted cheddar cheese on top

Fried Butterfly Shrimp: can't go wrong with this, its boxed shrimp, yum yum good :-)

Green Beans: greens beans are my fav, um yea they were greasy too and limp, no snap

Peppered Chicken: that was decent, but the jalapenos took over my pallet so I had to pick around it

Crab Ragoons and Egg Rolls: once again you cannot go wrong w/ fried foods

Pot Stickers: dough was gummy, at the edges it was hard as if they had been sitting out for a long time

Pizza: this is my little dudes favorite, he can eat 3 regular slices...he ate 1 slice and picked at the other slice

Sweet and Sour Chicken: no need for the sauce because the chicken was hard as HELL, another item  that had been sitting out way too long.  needles to say that was not consumed

Friend Chicken Wings: I didn't eat them, but my kid enjoyed them.  I'll say it again,  you cannot go wrong w/ fried foods

the SERVICE: BAD enough said (-2STARS for bad service)

Overall, food was not even So-So, I've had better, HELL - we've ALL had better. $25.97 for $5.00 buffet food.  I'm so done

The servers take the plates off the table must faster, and they don't neglect you anymore! Yaaay to not be neglected!!! 

Food is still food. It's a Chinese buffet. You get what you pay for, and you can't really complain. This is NOT a luxury casino buffet, this is a buffet off the strip. So if you're expecting some gourmet Chinese food, this place is not for you! You'll have the usual mediocre sushi bar, the cream cheese wontons, cream cheese baked green mussels (YUM!), etc etc etc. I like the food here, so I don't have anything to complain about.

Sure it's $8 a person but you're going to get what you pay for, you're better off getting frozen Chinese for $4 from the grocery store. Drive the extra 5 min and just go to Chinatown. And to top all of that, the wait staff is just as bad. There was an elderly person that can't walk very fast in my party and before I could get out of the booth they had come to flip the table and bumped her out of the way just about knocking her over.

This time was no different. Despite the reviews on Yelp this place got Best of Las Vegas (at least if my memory serves me right) so we decided to try it. It was at a premium price, for this place, around $16 for the weekend seafood buffet. We went on Saturday night, no wait but extremely busy. Service was poor, I had to track someone down when I wanted a drink refill and in the middle of dinner they took my soy sauce away. I thought to fill it or exchange and bring it back, but no it was just gone.  They had less selection of Chinese food than I expected, maybe because there was more seafood. A lot of people were eating the snow crab, but that is just way too much work for me for so little reward, I am a king crab or nothing kind of girl unless it is already cracked open. They also had salt and pepper frog legs, which was different, although I didn't try it. The only thing that I liked was some sort of seafood medly on a shell with a baked on mayonnaise sauce. I recently saw a poster that bacon was the duct tape of food, and if that is so I think mayonnaise is like the glue - it helps quite a bit to repair food that would otherwise lack in flavor. They had a small sushi bar, and it was well meh - I guess I should be thankful there was any sushi, and there were a few different kinds - tako, salmon, tuna, eel, a number of norimaki rolls. The rolls were okay. Also, I tried the white fish but I wasn't sure what type of white fish it was, maybe Tilapia, but it really wasn't that good. They had salt and pepper squid, which again was okay.  So yes - overall I would say, some items were okay at best but I won't ever be coming back.",2,0,3

They have this rule that if you come in and pay during lunch, you can only eat the food that's out for lunch. Once the time for dinner hits you can't eat the foods that are labeled ""dinner only."" That pretty munched suck.

Good Chinese food. Decent price. Great selection. Better than most Asian buffets. About $9 for lunch, not including drinks. Prices for dinner differ on weekends. Your food will be hot and seasoned well. The sushi bar is just a decent alternative to Chinese food.  Nothing spectacular about the sushi. This place is always busy so food is constantly coming out. Teriyaki chicken, steamed gingered fish, and potstickers are my favorite. As for service, the employees seem to be working themselves to the bone, especially during lunch and dinner hours.

Note: this place is often packed! Wait time especially on the weekends can be 20 minutes or more. Lunch will not include crabs. Lobster tails will only be included on the dinner weekend menu. Prices change during dinner and weekends will be more.

Dinner (weekend) - My husband likes it because the price is reasonable for AYCE. He likes the snow crabs, and the salt and pepper dungeness crabs. He also likes the frog legs, buttered shrimp, Manila clams, oysters, oxtail soup, tomyun, and Mongolian barbecue. I find the food salty for my taste. I eat the lobster tails (you have to elbow your way to the lobster tail area or stand and wait for a new batch which comes in every 15 to 20 minutes) and sushi but secretly throw away the rice (and yes...I feel guilty thinking of the many hungry people but my stomach cannot tolerate too much rice). Their desserts consist of cheap cakes and pastry, jello, jell and cookies. Fruits are typical:  cantaloupe, grapes, watermelon and canned fruits.

170568,5Tln5qQTaZ90S6BkT9BseQ,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"For most Angelinos, Las Vegas is a little like the playground that's just a few blocks away.  More and more the Las Vegas strip is going Asian.

Besides the typical China Star Buffet located on the central strip, there are dozens of other oriental options to choose from in Vegas, on and off the strip. To reach the Chinese area travel west of the strip on the street called Spring Mountain, between Sahara and Flamingo. The banquet begins just a few blocks from the casinos. There are Chinese seafood restaurants, Dim Sum places, Malaysian, Vietnamese, Korean and even some full fledged Chinese grocery stores, up and down the street. But one of the things I always keep my open for when it comes to Las Vegas, are buffets. And my absolute favorite find was Buffet Asia, a ten minute drive west of Chinatown, just off Sahara on Pleasant Street.

For three days we asked the local Chinese what the best place in town was and uniformly they recommended this place. I was skeptical at first, for one; because in my experience the best Chinese restaurants are never outside of the Chinese area, and two, the name was suspiciously non Chinese (the best places always have weird translations like ABC Seafood). But Buffet Asia was the real thing. The buffet set us back about $15 for adults and half that for kids on a Saturday night, this place was well worth it, starting with a well stocked sushi table, abundant in tuna, salmon, clam and eel sushi plus some very creative rolls. Following that are the soups (wonton, miso, hot & sour, and egg drop corn), not as good as made-to-order but for a buffet they were excellent. But don't fill up on those items because next comes the many traditional main dishes, like snow crab legs (both steamed and fried in garlic), orange chicken, sweet and sour shrimp, oysters, frogs legs, spicy green beans, Chinese vegetables in sauce and many more. My favorites were the clams in black bean, the soy sauce fish, and the lobster in supreme sauce. By the time I was done with all that I was stuffed, and I hadn't even gone to the Mongolian barbeque yet, which offered fresh (not frozen) meats and seafood including thick cut Korean style short ribs, squid steaks, and fresh shrimp. Tea, non-alcoholic drinks, and dessert are included in the price.

So if you are tired of the same old food in Las Vegas and you don't want to break the pattern by breaking the bank at one of the name restaurants on the strip, then I recommend a trip into the interior to check out the local Chinese fare. It turned out to be a real treat for me.",4,0,7
170569,6TD7LmEZcK4Lxe5LqtX-VQ,ME0olHUKPsJ9spaLudZlYA,"TLDR: sodas/tea not free; to-go available; ample seating; no charge for leftovers

This Buffet @ Asia location reflects the hard work of employees in making this location safe for the public. Make no mistake: not all locations are the same. Be wary of the other ones!

The service up front and table side is pleasant. You must pay prior to seating and no refunds are made once the transaction has completed. A gratuity is charged for parties over 8, but they check waters often enough and the waiters/servers never stop moving. 

The food is par and not over the top. There isn't a flavor that stands out and it's pretty standard. It's what you expect at any Asian buffet place. Panda's express makes this location seem sub-par, but I'm sure others might frown upon my opinion. 

Drinks are not free. They cost $0.95 which is not a bad deal, but maybe you might want it for the Chinese tea. The restaurant also has a sushi bar and soft serve machine. The rice is too vinegary, but that probably means it's safe at any temperature.",3,1,10

The sticky rice was great paired it with some bachali koora (Chinese Spinach) some vegetable potstickers, sweet n sour sauce over the rice, cream cheese won ton, and one piece of orange chicken for a taster.

The lo mein was pretty great, steamed vegetables good amount of garlic and less seasoning, pork and beef skewers were great. 

The sushi wasn't the poorest quality I have ever had and wasn't fantastic but the fact that it's there for so cheap and in abundance at that is pretty kick butt.

The fried octopus was a little chewy probably a result of being held to long in the chaffing dish. I didn't expect greatness from the octopus on a buffet line and should have steered clear but I was interested if they pulled it off.

Dessert was nice I had an espresso cake.

With regards to service, the front counter lady was friendly.  Service was prompt.  They refilled my drink twice very promptly.  Overall very good service.

Exterior: The building itself actually looks appealing and in good condition. There is a large parking lot so finding a space is usually not a problem. It's cross streets are Rainbow and Sahara, it is next to a diner which I will try soon.

Interior: When you open the first set of double doors there are a few coin operated toy machines to get your last couple quarters due to the kids nagging. After the second set of double doors you are inside the restaurant, the counter to your left is where you pay and get taken to your table from. The dining area is large and has a couple separate rooms so you don't feel overcrowded. There are 6 food serving areas in the middle of the buffet containing various food items to choose from, there is a long service area containing fruit and desserts with an ice cream machine next to it, there is another long service area containing a good variety of sushi, and lastly there is a grill area for all of your Mongolian bbq to be prepared. I heard there is a bar but I have not seen it.

Food: The food is average with nothing to get excited about but for less than $9 you really can't expect the best or complain. The various dishes in the middle of the buffet are usually hot and switched out regularly. The chow mein, chicken with jalapenos, cream cheese rangoon, and sushi is usually what I stick with. The sushi is actually decent for the price and has a lot of rolls to select. I got a spring roll yesterday and it was extremely greasy. I also got some of the butterfly fried shrimp and they were undercooked. Like I said the food is cheap and I will return when the wallet is light.

Service: The service is actually good. I always get seated quickly considering I always want a booth. The staff never let your drinks go empty and are constantly refilling them. Your finished plates are picked up in a timely manner, sometimes you get a glance if you leave a mountain of food like I have a couple times due to not liking it, but they don't charge you for wasting food so that's ok. 

I give it 3 stars due to the butterfly fried shrimp being undercooked and for waiting for close to 5 mins for the Mongolian bbq cook to show up, he didn't so I ended up leaving a bowl of uncooked food there.",3,0,8

Having found KJ Seafood and Dim Sum at the Rio a good value for high quality cart service as a packed dining room assured freshly circulating plates throughout our ninety minute stay it was with a group of five that I sat down at Spring Mountain staple Cathay House hoping to further dispel rumors of Sin City's subpar dim sum but with slipshod service and too few patrons even on Saturday at noon the results were, at best, mixed.  Starting at the door where hasty greetings lead us to the back room it would be less that thirty seconds after seating that the blitzkrieg began - baskets and steamers that had clearly been propped against the wall shoved in our faces with several selections requiring an unannounced trip to the kitchen microwave - and kicking off with a trio of steamed options it was only BBQ Pork buns that proved competent as rubbery XLB and Shu Mai skins undermined otherwise juicy contents.  Still frenetic in pace as a $16 lobster special with slippery noodles swimming in ginger found its way to the table alongside a trio of excellent baked pastries it would unfortunately not be long before these gems were lost amidst overly salted garlic smelt and a dry coconut sponge, the duo immediately leaving me parched  as beverage refills lagged.  Admittedly underwhelmed at this point but willing to go one more round it was at long last (actually only 40 minutes) that Cathay House would rally with a strong finish from a duo of kitchen fresh carts - the crispy duck, sticky pork ribs, and supple shrimp balls all piping hot and reference standard leaving me to wonder what could have been had everything else been delivered fresh.",2,0,4
171952,cs3pIfdW2YrMvB3nJ0r2NQ,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,"This was only the second time I have been to Cathay House. I came for dim sum years ago and didn't have much of a desire to return but I couldn't resist giving them another chance recently.

We arrived around noon and they weren't too busy. I felt rushed to order, even though we kept telling them we wanted to wait for our entire party to be seated. We ordered hot tea and waters all around and then proceeded to order from the carts that came around. 

They pushed the ginger scallion lobster with pasta on us and although a good value at $15.99, it had to be reheated before they served it to us. The lobster was chewy and the noodles felt like total filler, didn't have much flavor and were overcooked. The highlights from our meal were the custard buns and crab balls. The ribs had to be reheated for us before serving which was a turn off.

The rest of the items we ordered weren't very memorable and I wouldn't recommend most, if any, of it. The coconut bun, egg custard, bbq pork buns and smelt were all completely forgettable.

Service was ok, although refills were a little hard to come by for our waters and tea. There are other dim sum places in town I prefer with fresher items, so I don't see myself coming back any time soon.",1,0,8

It just comes down to the food and that's where this place delivers. Everything we tried we liked. I'm not an expert on dim sum so I cant comment on each dish individually. We really liked everything. The servers were really nice too. I've been to other places where the servers aren't friendly so that is a plus in my book. So give them a try.,4,1,7

Savory dim sum circulated on two steam carts. 
Cart 1: chicken feet, ha gow, steamed bbq pork buns, and rice roll. 
Cart 2: steamed black bean spareribs, siu mai, salty egg yolk bun.
One more cart offered do hua (tofu pudding with ginger syrup). 

Didn't see a fried items/dessert items cart, but we were able to order shrimp stuffed bell pepper, crab claws in shrimp paste, and turnip cakes from a waiter. The restaurant was out of fried taro with pork/mushroom filling (my favorite). All of the items were fine, but no real standouts.

If you go there after 5, and order Dim Sum, it's going to be the old Chinese saying;

""We reheat it, when you want to eat it"".

It won't be fresh.

On the positive side, they are open very late night, like till 6am, so you can take the gang for late night, However, order something they can't reheat.",2,0,3

All you have to do is tell the people pushing the carts which food you want, and they mark it down on your check and give it to you. You can't just take off the food from the cart, they wouldn't be able to write it down on the check if everyone did that. The Chinese ladies seem very friendly and want to let everyone try the food, and the men working are very quick and get the job done.

I pretty much order the run of the mill dim sum. Shumai, Hargow, BBQ pork Chow Fun, steamed pork buns, pan fried noodles, etc. You get the idea. All of their dishes. DELICIOUS!

They are very slow. Only 2 carts running with barely any dim sum. I've never been to a dim sum restaurant where I have to wait 10 minutes for a cart to come by my table. The restaurant isn't even big! 

The restaurant is smart though. They are doing a promotion where it's half off all the dim sum dishes. Hmmm I wonder why?? Because this restaurant is awful. They do this to lure people in and show that there are actually a lot of people. When I first came in the restaurant, I was thinking it must be good because there are so many people here, but I was fooled.

171971,H7vJE1_JovfhQaZoNPvWjg,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,"I love love love Chinese food. I have friends who own a Chinese restaurant in North County (San Diego) -  their food is spectacular, and their customer service is second to none. I've come to expect similar experiences wherever I choose to dine.

However, during a recent trip to Las Vegas, my expectations were, for lack of a better term, pissed on! My friends decided to have dim sum at Cathay House Chinese Cuisine. They claimed that this place served good Chinese food. I've come to decide that they lied to me!

Dining here was an absolute WTF moment for me. For one, the food was subpar. The rolls were not baked fully, and the chicken feet lacked flavor, yet were swimming in suspicious looking sauce. My sweet and sour chicken was neither sweet nor sour - the cook apparently could not be bothered to put sauce on my dish. I will say their noodles were . . . edible, but a little salt would have gone a long way.

The food aside, the piss poor customer service was criminal! Apparently, the staff at Cathay have clearly designated roles from which they would not deviate. Every time I'd ask a food server for something, they'd tell me, rather rudely, ""That's the waiter's job, not mine."" Twice when we asked for more water, we were told everyone at the table already had a glass (did the service staff not notice our glasses were empty? We were in a desert, and needed our hydration!). My favorite WTF moment came when I asked for a fork. I got a baby-sized plastic fork to use instead. Did I fail to mention that any request we made was ""honored"" with dirty looks?

My friends were horrified, I was pissed, and the pennies we left behind as a tip hopefully conveyed our displeasure with Cathay House of Chinese Cuisine. The entire staff (save for the cashiers) need some training in cooking and customer service.",2,1,10
171972,sRmKKzadTKk7SiDfvGLEWw,Xnwjo2TUu4AyGdmsxeG7OQ,"Cathay house conveniently offers up dim sum everyday until 5pm (they close at 5pm every day) and we were also informed that specifically on weekdays, their dim sum is offered at special discounted prices.

We arrived at about 3:45pm on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty, except for another table of 3 sitting by us. The server promptly rolled out a steaming cart and we began ordering. There were a few other items that we wanted to order that weren't in the cart, but we were able to easily and quickly place a special order for them. Unfortunately one item came out cold, (radish cake) - I didn't mind flagging her down to ask her if she can warm it up for us, but it is kind of a turn off that it came to us cold.

My favorites:
- Sui Mai was fluffy, tender, moist and very flavorful. Super addicting. 
- BBQ steamed buns (white bao) - lots of bbq pork filling and the white bao buns were soft and fluffy.
- BBQ pork buns (glossy buns) - The filling was very minimal, but it tasted great. Also, the buns were soft and sweet. 
- Fried shrimp balls served with 
sweet mayo came out hot and crispy. They weren't the best, but I still enjoyed them. 
- Chicken feet had good flavor and they were meaty. 

These were edible but not my favorite: 
- Har gow - the clear wrapper was too thick and chewy. The shrimp filling flavor was alright, but it's not my favorite version of har gow. 
- Rice noodles with shrimp - these were dried out and overcooked.
- Radish cake - came out cold, mushy, and oily. Not served with crispy edges like I'm used to. 

Our overall dim sum meal was filling and satisfying. We would return, but only if we are craving dim sum on a random day after 3pm. Other than that, we will continue to make our way out to KJ Dim Sum - they still hold the throne of best dim sum in Vegas!",3,0,3

I went for dinner during the week and during dim sum on the weekends.  I prefer this place during dim sum, it is a huge 180.  They are kind enough to let your order off the menu if you have weekend favorites and it's like Tuesday night, which is very nice.  We got their roast duck, calamari, Chinese greens in oyster sauce, and the crispy pork. OMG that crispy pork and dipping sauce, I can't remember what the sauce was but it was good.. and the pork!

Egg rolls are more like spring rolls and I don't really care much for them.  Their Egg Foo Yung is decent enough, but can be a bit greasy.  Prices are average I suppose for carry-out Chinese.  Not great, but definitely good.  Be sure to add your coupon if ordering online because they WILL NOT offer it to you over the phone.  :)",3,0,9

They had online ordering/menu available, but turned it off.  When you ask the woman at the restaurant she tells you to just call in your order.  Problem is that you can tell her you'll be there in 10 minutes and they don't start the food until you arrive.  Kind of defeats the purpose of calling ahead.  Grumpy service = loss of customers = loss of $.  If the service isn't good it doesn't matter how good the food is for us.  We will be shopping around the area now for a new 'regular' Chinese take-out restaurant.  What a shame!",1,0,6

286757,PuIwwfEmcoha07hufiFm2Q,7VDrYNPhDKFURZbK4MRi8w,"This review is going off of a catered event from Red Shrimp we had recently at work.

I've heard up and down reviews about Red Shrimp.  The reason my work went with this place for our luncheon was because of their ad placed in one of the local papers.  It had coupons for some extras with qualifying orders.  I'm guessing we got a decent deal for the food to feed 60+ folks.

The food from Red Shrimp however?  Kinda MEH.  Very MEH.  Not my favorite type of hole-in-the-wall Chinese food that I like.  Maybe it was in the execution?  Maybe it was because it was delivered and not eaten at the restaurant?  It just wasn't that great to me.  The food from Panda Express I think I even like more.

Here's the dealio:

-The lo mein was OILY.  Like greasy.  Greasier than usual.  Very slick going down, not yummy.

-The egg rolls were pretty basic.  Possibly store bought and just fried.  But damn was the ginger strong in them.

-The beef broccoli was average.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't stellar either.  It's what you find at any Chinese restaurant here.

-The sweet sour pork was hard!  Might have been overfried or stood too long before serving.  There were bits of pork in there that were difficult to chew.  Taste was ok, but damn did I have a lot of onions to go through.

-Main saving grace was the chicken fried rice.  This was the best thing on my plate(s).  That in itself was pretty yummy, but how hard is it to mess up fried rice??

If we were to have our work luncheon catered again by Chinese, we would probably decide to go somewhere else.  The food from Red Shrimp was really under par and not of the best taste.  You guys need to step it up!",2,1,6
286758,Q6ZT8PBlZl1-6qQAfJFEYA,7VDrYNPhDKFURZbK4MRi8w,"It's an okay place. Not great but that bad. I would come here again.  
We got teriyaki chicken, shrimp and beef. And also shrimp with vegetables. 
I will say that the portions are huge!! My teriyaki I had to take it home and ate twice that day because there was so much. So that's great! The food is worth the money. 
The shrimp with vegetables was pretty yummy and I loved the meat in the teriyaki but their sauce cannot be called teriyaki. It did not taste like teriyaki at all and I didn't really like it. But the plate was good and I would actually order it again. 
Wasn't the best food but decent food. 
What I thought was really rude was that the lady brought us the wrong order to our table. We were hungry so we were gonna start eating. And she came over and took all the food without saying anything. So we were so confused. 
I don't mind that the order was wrong but she could have said why she was taking our food. Or even a simple ""sorry"" would have been fine. 
But overall I would come again.",3,1,4

the order arrived hot and fresh  and so quick. we had ordered 8 entrees  and got a free walnut shrimp  that all came with 3 containers of white rice and we also had a order or house lo mein and house fried rice! 

they send TWO drivers to carry it up the stairs and brought it it these huge boxes and I was SO surprised with the amount of food we ordered nothing spilt nothing got squished and they gave us SO many cookies and utensils and soy sauce omg we will be ordering this next Chinese party we have again VERRY soon !!!!",4,1,9

This night I had an all girl sleepover and we were hungry due to the party favors. We wanted Chinese, we were craving Chinese so it had to be!

What we ordered:

crab rangoons, egg rolls, cashew chicken, garlic shrimp, sweet walnut shrimp, shrimp in lobster sauce, pepper beef, house fried rice, house lo mein, orange chicken.

It took two delivery people to carry the two heavy boxes of food. We had a mini Chinese buffet going on in my Condo :) You must go and look at the photos I uploaded for this review!

Ok so the service was excellent, the food was hot and fresh! Everything was delicious especially the honey walnut shrimp. Our only item that we did not care for was the shrimp in lobster sauce. No flavor at all and it was super runny and unappealing. 

I am happy to say that this last experience has bumped the Red Shrimp Co up to a 4 star rating which is a huge jump from previous ratings. 

This will be one of our reclaimed spots for Chinese take-out and delivery. However I won't hold my breath because their track record is NOT consistent!

Step one to finding delicious and affordable food in Vegas is to get off the strip. So, that's what my family and I did by coming to this restaurant, located in Vegas' ""chinatown"" or along Spring Mountain Road. 

Come here a little before the usual dinner rush on weekends about 6 o clock to avoid waiting. Right after we arrived, multiple parties came and had to wait for a table because the whole place filled up so quickly. 

You must try the garlic beef, pad thai, and papaya salad. Each dish was executed well and the food was brought out fairly quickly. 

My family ordered 5 dishes for 5 of us and there was still some left over. The total came out to be under $60 which is really not bad at all. 

This place is now on my list for some good Thai home cooking if I'm ever sick of the buffets and sky high prices on the strip.

The quantity was pretty small for the price. I felt like the place is a bit small? Since my neighbor's back is only about half a foot away from mine. Maybe a little rearranging of tables might help with rooms. Our server was nice but from my experience I don't recall him checking up on us. I think we waved and called him to us. Cups of water were small and we never had a refill. My gf had to drink my grandma's cup of ice water since they never refilled our cups for us.

I feel like whenever I take a bite of their food, this is what Thai food should taste like. Their Chinese food is pretty good too, although it may not be as authentic as a normal Chinese place, they serve some good Chinese food here as well.

I've been coming to this place with my family for a number of years now. I always love coming to this place for the food and I enjoy chatting with some of the waiters. It's friendly for family, and large parties if necessary. 

My favorite things to eat from here are the pad thai, pad se ew, and general Tso's chicken. Kung Fu gets pad thai correctly and cooks their pad se ew well and both have flavor. Their general Tso's chicken is sweet and has a slightly spicy flavor to it and this is best eaten at the restaurant so it is still crispy when you eat it! I have ordered their curry, vegetable dishes, tom kha soup, and I enjoy them all!

Anyway I picked up my order got back home, I went to taste my tum yum soup and it had a roach floating at the top of my soup. I could have died.

I went to Las Vegas for the summer and ate at a restaurant every day for a week, but Kung Fu Thai and Chinese Restaurant was definitely my favorite. My uncle kept saying that Thai food is good, but I've never tried it and pushed to eat at other restaurants.

On our last night there, we tried this place. I was just FLOORED by how scrumptious each and everyone one of my bites of food were. The waiters provided EXCELLENT service and they were so kind! We went at night, so it was just our huge family of around 30 and another small family at a table near us.

Foods I ate:
-Tom Yum soup
-Seasoned fish (forgot what it was called, but I hate fish and this was one of the only times I enjoyed eating it!)
-MONGOLIAN BEEF *YES YES YES*

It's exceptionally pleasing! Of course, I had to go with Pineapple Fried Rice (my favorite!) and theirs comes in huge portions with chicken, pork, shrimp, and crab! What a catch! (You see what I did there?) My coworker went with the pad thai and she liked it.

I told her that "" a lot can change in seven years"", and I was right. 

We both agreed that this was one of the worst Chinese meals we ever had.

The staff did try to please, but they just could not over come the bad food that came out of the kitchen. We ordered a curry dish, kung pao chicken, and a shrimp dish.

My wife took one look at the curry dish and said, ""When I saw it, I knew we were in trouble.""  She was right. Poor quality ingredients, and no taste to it.

The Kung Pao Chicken, a standard which I use to compare Chinese places, was awful. My dogs turned down the left over chicken; The peanuts were few, and tasted like they were purchased from a ball park, six months after the season ended, and the dish tasted liked it was cooked in Motor oil.

Remember those terrible shrimp that are in those 99 cent cocktails in Downtown Casinos? Ever wonder where the ones they reject go? This is the place!!

Top off the food with booths where the fabric is torn apart and needs replacement, and you risk sitting with a spring up your butt, and you have a perfect picture of

287373,aOpKXr-i2mL43AosbMW-6Q,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"Having a craving for Thai food in Vegas once again, my friend recommended yet another she was familiar with. So far, I think you can't really go wrong as pretty much all the Asian restaurants I've been brought to has yet to disappoint me. This place was no different.

It's one of the typical informal Asian restaurants you'll find in Chinatown....dated decor and nothing 5 star about it. That's fine as these places are frequented for the food and not the decor. Not to say there isn't any atmosphere as there's hodge podge of Thai and Chinese antiques and motifs.

Like most Asian restaurants, it's probably best to go in larger groups as there are so many dishes to try and the portions are quite generous. Since it was just my friend and I, we just ordered the fish cakes, Pad See Ew (fried flat rice noodles) and the Pad Wan Sen (fried clear noodles). The flat rice noodles was pretty good, but just a bit sweet for my taste. I had actually ordered the fried clear noodles which were quite delicious. However, I had just had this this dish at another Thai restaurant a few days ago, and the other restaurant's taste edges out this one a bit in terms of taste quality. Still good though, and a good sized plate of noodles. The fish cakes were not too bad either, but for some reason parts of it were dry or hard to the chew. 

For a good Thai and Chinese restaurant both in one, and not too far from the strip, then this is definitely a place I'd come to again. Service was good (likely because it wasn't a busy time of day), good sized portions, and the food was worth the money. The other Thai restaurant I really enjoyed was a good 4-5 miles from the strip in a suburban strip mall, and probably a bit too far from the strip to venture out to, unless you have a car and GPS. This place is convenient.",4,0,10
287374,1tYqpXcw7DMQwZHZKo351g,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"This place was packed on a Monday night.  Service was mediocre.  They didn't come and check on us very often.  My sprite (which I got with a Yelp check in) was pure carbonation and with very little to no ""sprite"" syrup.  You can order most items with our without ""spicy""

Chicken Wings:  Very good crispy but tender.  The sweet chili sauce had no heat to it but it was delightful.

Pad Sew Ew:  Pretty solid as far as this traditional Thai dish goes.  Nice flavor, not too much overpowering sauce.

Shrimp Salad:  Refreshing and light.  Shrimp with a light sauce on a bed of lettuce.  The salad was crisp and the shrimp were cooked well.

Shrimp Fried Rice:  Really no flavor at all.  I give them item a 1 star at best.  I've had fried rice at a lot of Thai restaurants and this dish had no flavor whatsoever.

Chicken with Basil:  A little greasy but very flavorful.  The basil flavor really pops out.  Just sop up some of the grease with your steam rice to balance it out.",3,1,9
287375,xkcXUnLFT3BQhvSPTNO69A,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"Adequate service, they could have tried to be at least more attentive. I even asked for those 4 chili sauces from one of the waiters and I still didn't even get it when my table and I finished our food. And we had to seat ourselves in because they weren't even paying attention to is near the entrance. But I must say, I've tried Thai restaurants from both California and Nevada and this place has good food, the dishes here are so perfectly seasoned, there is no too sweet, too plain, or too salty or not enough saltiness. Probably coming back again when I visit Las Vegas.",4,1,10

287378,jtyQOIE7R2dvbHXpqw6iUw,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"Ended up in this disaster after one of our usual places was full of a tour group. It took around 10 minutes for anyone to come to the table to take our order after being sat. Little did we know this was the beginning of a pattern.My coworkers and I ordered off of the lunch menu (which for the price looks pretty good, I guess that is what gains them the one mandatory star above). Then the waiting game it took a very long time to get the food. The lunch special comes with egg and flour soup which we received first. It was bland and not very good, had to add soy sauce to it to make it even palatable. About 30 plus minutes later we received our entrees. The food was underwhelming at best. I had the Kung Pao chicken with fried rice, egg roll and Thai fried chicken wing. The chicken wing and egg roll were not too bad, but the rest was sub par and not very good. I believe I could have gotten a better meal at an Asian fast food restaurant. Then it took close to 15 minutes to get our check, followed by another long wait to get it back. It caused one of my coworkers to miss a meeting. Not sure how this place has made it as long as it has.",1,1,6

My allergies have been kicking me in the face the last few days...so when I called to let my fella know I was on my way home from work, he said ""I'm going to order us some Thai food.""

Ok. I don't have to cook or anything...deal. 

We'd never ordered from Kung Fu Thai before, and let me tell you...we will absolutely be ordering from them again. 

Delivery was prompt.  I don't think he had called until after 6pm, and our food arrived about 6:45pm.  Not too bad!

We had:

Crab Rangoon:  Probably some of the best rangoons I've had in Vegas.  Absolutely divine.

Egg Rolls:  On par with Thai BBQ on Maryland and Sahara.  REALLY good egg rolls.

Pad Thai: YUM.  Flavorful,and a good sized portion.

Ginger beef:  favorite of the night!  Delicious.  Tender beef, a little spice...wowza.  So good.

Yellow curry:  VERY yummy.  Fresh basil, chicken, and zucchini.  No potatoes, which is kind of weird to me, but still amazing.  (I'm having left overs for lunch today.)

I really enjoyed the food, and intend to order in from them again.",4,1,6

287382,BXJj6M6CcuWWawM-FIedAg,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"I'm visiting Vegas for a convention. Unfortunately, my hotel is off the strip and with 104 degree temperatures the last thing I wanted to do was go back out in the heat for food. Did an Internet search for places that deliver. A million pizza joints, but I wanted something different. Came across some good reviews for Kung Fu so I placed an online order.

About two minutes after the order was placed, a gentleman called from Kung Fu to verify some of the things on my order. Whhaaaaat? A restaurant that doesn't just guess but actually follows up with the customer? Amazing! He told me the food would be delivered in an hour but it was more like 30-45 minutes.

And it was sooooo good. I was craving egg drop soup and theirs didn't disappoint. I had also ordered the chicken with chili and mint over rice and received a HUGE portion for the price. Got a large drink too. Cost for everything plus delivery and tip was only about $22, making it more than worth it. Not to mention the awesomeness of having it delivered to my hotel.

Definitely will be keeping this one on my list for future trips to the area. It's easy to understand why they've been open so long!",5,1,10

287387,GNiJ2IwcDAxnHJZBYwzUQg,2Dbg35sPSGmZGcbBVNa9dA,"It's surprisingly difficult to find places that deliver in Vegas. Everyone in the office is completely sick of Jason's Deli 3 days in a row, so we tried something different and so glad we did. I've only had the Thai food from Kung Fu, but it's one of the few places in Chinatown that delivers, and figured we'd give their food a try.

We did the order by phone since it was catering, but I was really surprised that their website allows you to do the order online for delivery or pick up. Helps a lot with the language barrier - I don't speak Chinese or Thai, but my coworker made me order (in English!) because she had trouble understanding them. 

We were able to feed 12-14 people for about $160 which is really good. Delivery was on time and there was no minimum or delivery fee. I wasn't blown away by the Chinese food, but it was above average with generous servings at a really reasonable price. I think each half pan was around $40. 

It's not my personal go-to for Chinese or Thai, but the fact that they're cheap, so close to the strip and have delivery makes this place 5-star if you're visiting. Beats paying $25 for sweet & sour chicken from a casino restaurant.",4,1,4

We waited some more...the waiter finished eating and went to the back let people in the back know we were waiting...but still no one came...we left.

We enter and it's pretty busy, but no line at the door so it seemed like we were going to get decent service.

Damn man. We got seated and we were promptly brought water however we waited about fifteen minutes for someone to come by to take our drink and food order. After about twenty, a server finally came over and took everything at once. 

After another fifteen minutes, still no drinks so I got up and asked where they were, and as soon as she brought the food is when we got our drinks. The food was decent, however we had to get up, travel to a dirty table, and get our own soy sauce. Also the portions were pretty small. I ordered the general tso chicken and she had the bbq pork wonton soup.

The food like I said, was decent. It's just the service was so awful I couldn't take it, I honestly considered just walking out. There were only about 4 servers on the floor and obviously they were very overwhelmed. The bussers were amazing though, they really hustled their asses off. 

Next time hopefully the management staffs up for higher volume because I know this place has been in business for a long time and has great potential. Perhaps on a slower day we will check them out again if we are in the area.",2,1,2

so i took another minute to overlook the menu and saw veggie green curry for $8.50. i asked how much to add chicken to that, he said $1-$2. so i did that instead. 

menus need to be updated! my friend ordered panang and menu said it had 4 types of veggies so she got it. dish came out and it only had zuchinni! really? she told the waiter to take it back.
